## 🎯 CRITICAL FIX: Orchestrator → Execution Bridge Pipeline

### The Bug (found ~2:30 AM PST)
The orchestrator's `execute_trade` action handler was writing to `farm_decisions` with `"Simulated trade: ..."` but **never writing to `coordination_scratchpad`** as `pre_trade_intent`. The execution bridge only reads from `coordination_scratchpad`. Agents were thinking and deciding but their trade orders went to a table nobody was reading.

### The Fix
- **Commit `0ec9900`**: Wired `execute_trade` actions to write proper `pre_trade_intent` entries to `coordination_scratchpad`
- **Commit `9487036`**: Fixed column name (`payload` not `content`) and added `agent_name`, normalized confidence to 0-1 range
- File: `src/lib/farms/orchestrator.ts` lines ~624-665
