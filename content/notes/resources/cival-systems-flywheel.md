# The Cival Systems Flywheel

Everything is a funnel into trading. This is the core business model.

## The Loop

1. **Content Creation** (TikTok, YouTube) → Revenue + Audience
2. **Digital Products** (NFTs, The 400 Club) → Revenue + Community
3. **Services** (GWDS) → Revenue + Network
4. **All Revenue → Trading Capital** → Cival Dashboard → Leveraged Trades
5. **Trading Profits → Compound** → More Capital → Repeat

## Why It Works

- Multiple income streams reduce risk
- Every stream feeds the same machine (Cival Systems)
- Trading compounds — $1 today is $1.xx tomorrow
- Content builds audience which sells products which generates capital
- The family name (Cival, 4th generation) carries the legacy

## Current Revenue Streams

| Stream | Status | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Trading (Cival Dashboard) | LIVE | Highest |
| TikTok (6 channels) | Pre-launch | High |
| 400 Club NFT | Redeploying | Medium |
| Restaurant (Mother Wolf) | Active | Replace ASAP |

## Key Insight

Anthony doesn't need to pick one thing. The flywheel means everything reinforces everything else. The only question is execution speed.
