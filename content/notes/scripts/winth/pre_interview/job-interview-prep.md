=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft acoustic guitar. Single chord, warm.]

Close your eyes for just a moment.
Take a slow breath in through your nose.
Hold it gently. Now breathe out.
One more. Breathe in slowly.
And let it go with ease.

You are preparing for something important today.
And I want you to hear this clearly.
The nervousness you feel is not a warning.
It is proof that this matters to you.
That feeling is not your enemy.
It is your fuel.

You have prepared. You have studied. You have arrived.
You belong in this room.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Guitar continues, steady and soft.]

Here is the honest truth about nerves before interviews.
Most people don't prepare the way you are preparing now.
They memorize answers and hope for the best.
But they never settle the inside of themselves.
And when anxiety takes over, the best answers disappear.
The brilliant things you rehearsed become hard to find.

This is not about intelligence or capability.
This is about your nervous system being online.
And a nervous system without grounding
turns even a great candidate into a scattered one.

You are not scattered. You are here.
You are choosing to prepare the right way.
And that choice is already setting you apart.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters, warm and supporting.]

Here is your three-step arrival plan.
Plan: Ground. Prepare. Show.

Step one is to ground your body before you walk in.
Find a quiet space — a hallway, a car, a bathroom.
Stand with both feet flat on the floor.
Roll your shoulders back and down.
Take three slow breaths. Count them.
On each exhale, say this quietly to yourself:
"I am ready. I have prepared. I belong here."
That phrase is not a wish. It is a fact.
Say it like a fact.

Step two is to prepare your three core stories.
Every interview question is really asking one of three things.
Can you do this job. Will you do this job. Do you fit here.
Write your three strongest work stories right now.
Each one needs a situation, an action, and a clear result.
Keep each story under two minutes.
Practice once out loud — not to be perfect,
but to hear your own voice say it with confidence.

Step three is to show genuine curiosity, not desperation.
Walk in as if you are also evaluating them.
Because you are. This is a two-way conversation.
When they talk about the role, lean in slightly.
Ask one thoughtful question before you leave.
"What does success look like in the first ninety days?"
That one question signals preparation and partnership.

If anxiety spikes before you answer, then pause briefly.
Say: "That's a great question. Let me think for a moment."
That pause is professional. It shows thoughtfulness.

If you forget part of your answer, then stay with what you know.
Finish the thought you started. Do not apologize mid-sentence.

If the interview feels awkward or stilted, then slow down.
Lower your pace slightly. Warmth fills the silence.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music slows to acoustic guitar alone.]

Picture yourself in that room right now.
You are seated. Your posture is open and calm.
The interviewer asks their first question.
You breathe. You smile slightly. You begin.
Hear your voice — clear, grounded, sure.
Feel the ease of someone who has done the work.
Not performing. Just being yourself. Fully.

I am the person who prepares and then lets go.
I am curious, capable, and genuinely ready.
I show up as myself — and that is the offer.
My preparation is complete. My presence is the gift.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Guitar fades to a single held note.]

Right now, say your name and your headline out loud.
"My name is [your name] and I bring [your value]."
Say it once. Stand tall. Mean it.

I am a prepared, grounded, and capable professional.
This interview today is a conversation, not a test.
I belong in this room.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a warm, gentle instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a single acoustic guitar chord — soft, reassuring, unhurried. At twenty seconds, add a light fingerpicked melody that feels like a kind hand on a shoulder. At one minute forty seconds, bring in a subtle cello line that adds emotional warmth without drama. At three minutes, soften everything to guitar alone — intimate and close. At three fifty-five, let the guitar fade to a single resonant note. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: kind, supportive, gently encouraging. Style: acoustic folk-chamber, intimate. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow close-up drift across a warm wooden desk with morning sunlight filtering through sheer curtains — soft and inviting. The camera moves very slowly left to right across the surface, revealing a glass of water, a closed notebook, a pen. The center of the frame stays clean and uncluttered for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: warm amber, ivory, soft cream tones. Loop strategy: camera eases from left to right, then gently reverses in a palindrome — seamless and calming. Atmosphere: quiet readiness, gentle confidence, morning calm. Loopable with no jump cuts.
