=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft piano. Open and patient.]

Find stillness before you step into that room.
Breathe slowly in. Hold gently.
Now release. Longer on the exhale.
Once more.

Here is a thought worth carrying in with you today.
Every room you enter is a garden.
Not a marketplace. Not an audition. A garden.
In a garden, you do not rush toward the harvest.
You plant. You tend. You let things grow.
The person you meet tonight may matter in three years.
The conversation you almost skipped may open a door
that you cannot yet see from where you stand.
Plant seeds today. That is the only job.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues, unhurried and warm.]

Here is the truth about most networking events.
People walk in with a transaction in mind.
What can I get. Who do I need to know.
How do I make an impression quickly enough.
And that energy — the energy of needing something —
is the most detectable energy in any room.
People feel it. They step back from it.

The irony is this.
The people who gain the most from networking
are the people who seem to need nothing from it.
They walk in curious. They ask generous questions.
They listen more than they speak.
They are genuinely interested in the person in front of them.
And that quality — genuine interest — is magnetic.
That is what we cultivate before you go in.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters quietly beneath the piano.]

Here is your three-step networking presence plan.
Plan: Arrive. Connect. Follow.

Step one is to arrive with one genuine mission.
Not "get three business cards" or "meet the keynote speaker."
Your mission is simpler and harder.
Have one real conversation tonight.
One conversation where you actually listen.
Where you ask a follow-up question.
Where you remember something they said.
One real conversation beats thirty shallow ones.
Quality is the metric. Not quantity.

Step two is to connect through questions, not pitches.
When you meet someone new, lead with curiosity.
"What are you working on right now that excites you?"
"What brought you into this field originally?"
"What is the challenge your organization is navigating?"
These questions open people. Pitches close them.
When someone feels genuinely heard, they remember you.
And they want to introduce you to the next person.
That is how a network actually grows.

Step three is to follow up within twenty-four hours.
Most networking value is destroyed in the silence after.
One brief email or message. No ask. Just a reference.
"It was great meeting you. I looked up the book you mentioned.
You were right — it's excellent."
That one message says: I listened. I followed through.
I am the kind of person worth knowing.

If you feel overwhelmed in a crowded room, then find one person.
Just one. A person standing slightly alone.
Walk over and introduce yourself. Ask one question.
The room becomes smaller one conversation at a time.

If the conversation runs dry, then return to curiosity.
"Tell me more about that." It works every time.
If you don't know anyone in the room, then that is your asset.
You have everything to discover. Start anywhere.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens. Just piano and quiet cello.]

Picture yourself in that room now.
You are not scanning. You are settled.
Someone nearby catches your eye.
You walk over with ease. You introduce yourself.
You ask one genuine question. They light up.
You listen. You remember. You connect.
Hear the ease in your voice as the conversation flows.
Feel the simple joy of real human contact.

I am the person who plants seeds wherever I go.
I am curious, generous, and genuinely present.
I do not work the room. I serve the room.
Every connection I make tonight is a seed.

[3:55-4:30] ATTENTION
[Single piano note. Soft and clear.]

Before you walk in tonight, set one intention.
"I am here to have one real conversation."
That is all.

I am the professional who builds real relationships.
I plant seeds. I tend connections. I let things grow.
Every room is a garden. Go tend it.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a warm, patient instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a gentle piano motif — unhurried, like someone taking the long view. At forty seconds, a light acoustic guitar enters, adding texture and warmth. At one minute forty seconds, both instruments explore together — easy, conversational, like two people who enjoy talking. At three minutes ten seconds, soften to piano alone, thoughtful and still. At three fifty-five, a final gentle phrase fades to quiet. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: generous, curious, warmly philosophical. Style: acoustic chamber, easy and open. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow drift through a warmly lit indoor garden or atrium space — plants, soft light, clean air. The camera moves slowly and curiously, as if exploring without destination. The center of the frame is clean and open for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: warm green, golden light, ivory and soft amber. Loop strategy: slow circular drift through the space — camera eases around a natural arc and returns smoothly to start in a seamless palindrome. Motion is exploratory, not directed. Atmosphere: curiosity, generosity, the pleasure of discovery. Loopable with no jump cuts.
