=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft piano. Bright and gently energizing.]

Take a slow breath in. This one matters.
Hold it gently. Feel it.
And let it go. All the way out.
One more. In.
And release.

Today is your first day.
The beginning of something genuinely new.
Not a performance. Not an audition.
A beginning.
And beginnings — when we let them — carry something special.
The freshness of not yet knowing everything.
The permission to ask questions without apology.
The chance to make a first impression that lasts for years.
This is a gift. Receive it consciously.
Walk in today not as someone who is trying to prove something.
Walk in as someone who is genuinely ready to learn.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues, warm and encouraging.]

Here is what undermines first day energy.
Putting too much pressure on the day to be perfect.
Trying to demonstrate everything in the first eight hours.
Showing up so eager to prove yourself
that you forget to actually see the environment you're entering.
First days are not for proving. They are for perceiving.
The people who navigate first days best
are the ones who arrive with curiosity as their primary tool.
Not expertise. Not answers. Curiosity.
They ask more than they tell.
They listen more than they speak.
They observe more than they perform.
That is how you earn trust on day one.
Not by being the smartest person in the room.
But by being the most genuinely interested one.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters. Warm, encouraging, grounded.]

Here is your three-step first day presence plan.
Plan: Arrive. Observe. Connect.

Step one is to ARRIVE with intention in your body, not just your mind.
Before you enter the building, pause outside.
Take a full breath. Set one intention for the day.
"Today I am here to listen and learn."
"Today I bring open energy and real curiosity."
One intention. Hold it.
Then when you walk in, greet people by name when introduced.
Say their name back: "Great to meet you, Sarah."
That practice does something powerful.
It signals that you are present, not just processing.
It tells every person: you matter to me from day one.

Step two is to OBSERVE the culture before you try to contribute to it.
Notice how people communicate.
Do they email? Do they message? Do they talk in person?
Notice the energy of the room.
Is it focused quiet? Collaborative buzz? Structured meetings?
Notice the unwritten norms.
How do people make decisions together?
Who do others seem to trust and why?
These observations take zero ability and require only attention.
They will save you from dozens of missteps
that new employees make by moving too fast.

Step three is to CONNECT with at least two people intentionally.
Not networking. Real, genuine conversation.
Ask one colleague about their work.
"How long have you been in this team? What do you like most about it?"
Then listen fully. Do not prepare your next question while they speak.
Be present. Remember what they say.
Follow up on it tomorrow.
"You mentioned yesterday that X was the main challenge.
Is there context I can read to understand it better?"
That one follow-up creates a week's worth of first impression.

If you feel imposter syndrome on day one, then write this.
"I was chosen for this role. Someone saw what I bring.
I am here to grow into this, and that is exactly the point."

If you make a mistake on day one, then own it briefly and move on.
"I realize I misunderstood that. Here is what I'll do instead."
First days include mistakes. How you handle them is the real impression.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens. Piano and warm strings.]

See yourself walking in on that first day.
Your eyes are open. Your energy is warm.
You greet someone and say their name back.
You listen with full presence in every early conversation.
Hear your own voice — curious, warm, genuinely engaged.
Feel the quiet joy of a beginning fully received.

I am the professional who begins with open eyes and an open heart.
I listen before I lead. I observe before I act.
First days are gifts. I receive this one fully.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano closes with a warm, bright resolution.]

Write your one intention for today right now.
Say someone's name back after they introduce themselves.
Ask one genuine question before ten in the morning.

I begin this chapter with presence and curiosity.
Today is the start of something meaningful.
I walk in open. Let's begin.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a bright, gently energizing instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a warm piano melody — fresh and welcoming, like the first moments of a new day. At thirty seconds, soft acoustic guitar joins with lightness and forward motion. At one minute forty seconds, a gentle cello provides grounding warmth beneath the brighter instruments. At three minutes ten seconds, piano and guitar play together, bright and encouraging. At three fifty-five, a final joyful resolving phrase. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: fresh beginning, open curiosity, warm welcome. Style: acoustic folk-chamber, gently uplifting. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow sunrise view from outside a glass office building — morning light gradually brightening across the facade, the world waking up. The camera holds still while the light shifts from pre-dawn grey to warm morning gold. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: dawn pink and amber, cool grey glass, brightening gold, soft blue sky. Loop strategy: light brightens slowly from pre-dawn to full morning, then eases back in a palindrome — day and early day cycling. Atmosphere: fresh beginning, open possibility, warm welcome. Loopable with no jump cuts.
