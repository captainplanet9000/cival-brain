=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Driving percussion intro. Energy building immediately.]

Breathe. Right now. One deep breath.
Take it. Fill your lungs completely.
Now exhale like you mean it.

Listen to me. Are you listening?
You have been doing the work. Every single day.
You have carried responsibilities above your title.
You have solved problems that weren't yours to solve.
You have led when you weren't asked to lead.
And today — TODAY — you are walking in and saying it out loud.
Not hinting. Not hoping. ASKING.
This is the moment. And you are ready for it.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Percussion steady. Energy focused.]

Here is what kills promotion conversations before they start.
Waiting for the manager to notice on their own.
Here is what else kills it.
Going in emotional, going in vague, or going in apologetic.
"I was just thinking maybe at some point possibly..."
No. That is not a promotion conversation.
That is a wish.

You have been building a case for months.
You just haven't been presenting it as one.
Today changes that.
Because the people who get promoted are not always the best performers.
They are the best performers who can articulate their performance.
You have the performance. Now we build the articulation.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Percussion builds. Energy purposeful and driving.]

Here is your three-step promotion conversation protocol.
Protocol: Evidence. Aspiration. Ask.

Step one is EVIDENCE — you walk in with documented proof.
Not feelings. PROOF.
Three specific contributions in the last six months.
Each one tied to a business outcome.
Not "I worked really hard on the project."
"I led the migration that reduced customer complaints by forty percent."
"I onboarded and mentored two new team members who are now top performers."
"I managed the campaign that generated three hundred thousand in revenue."
Hard numbers. Hard facts. Hard evidence.
Write them down before you go in. Three minimum.

Step two is ASPIRATION — you speak clearly about where you are going.
"I am ready to move into a senior role and here is why."
Not "I think I might be ready maybe."
"I AM ready. Here is the evidence. Here is where I want to go."
Name the next role by title. Name the responsibilities you're already doing.
Show the gap between your title and your actual work.
That gap is your argument. Make them see it clearly.

Step three is THE ASK — direct, clear, and specific.
"I am asking for a promotion to senior [title] by [specific date]."
Not "whenever you think is right."
A specific date. A specific title. A specific ask.
Then sit back. Let them respond.
You have made the case. The rest is their move.

If they say "not yet," then ask one question immediately.
"What specific milestones do I need to hit, and by when?"
If they can't answer that, you have learned something important.
Get the answer in writing before you leave.

If they push back on timing, then acknowledge and redirect.
"I understand. I am asking now so we can plan together toward it."
Do not apologize for asking. Asking is leadership.

If doubt spikes in the parking lot before you go in, then go anyway.
You already earned this. The conversation is just catching the paperwork up.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Percussion softens slightly. Focused and clear.]

See yourself sitting across from your manager right now.
You are calm. You are direct. You have the evidence with you.
You lay it out clearly, without apology, without rambling.
They are listening. They are nodding.
You say the words — "I am asking for this promotion."
Hear your own voice say it — clear and certain.
Feel the strength of someone who knows their worth and names it.

I am the professional who advocates for myself with evidence.
I do not wait to be discovered. I make myself visible.
I earn the ask every day. Today I make the ask.
I belong in that next role. The conversation confirms it.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Driving music to a decisive close.]

Right now, write down three outcomes you delivered this year.
Real numbers. Real impact. Your name on the result.
That is your case. Walk in with it today.

I have earned this. I am asking for this.
I move up because I show up.
Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a driven, energetic instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a sharp percussion pattern — purposeful and forward-moving, no wasted motion. At forty seconds, add a bass line and synth pad that builds momentum without losing control. At one minute forty seconds, the full arrangement enters — driving rhythm, melodic synth layers, a sense of earned intensity. At three minutes ten seconds, pull back to a focused, tight rhythm and bass only — decisive. At three fifty-five, end with a final powerful hit and fade. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: driven, purposeful, earned urgency. Style: modern hip-hop influenced motivational, controlled intensity. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A dynamic push down a glass office corridor at dusk — city lights visible through floor-to-ceiling windows, the path forward clear and deliberate. The camera advances at a purposeful pace — faster than a drift, but not rushing. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: deep navy, warm amber lights from the city, cool silver of the corridor. Loop strategy: forward advance through corridor to a glass door, then seamless cut back to the entrance — continuous forward motion, no backward motion. Atmosphere: earned arrival, forward momentum, purposeful confidence. Loopable with no jump cuts.
