=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Driving synth percussion. Immediate energy.]

One breath. Sharp. In and out.
Wake up. You are on.

Listen carefully. Virtual interviews are NOT easier.
They are HARDER. And most people don't treat them that way.
They show up in a dim room with a cluttered background.
Their camera is angled from below. Their audio cuts in and out.
They sound like an afterthought.
Meanwhile, someone else in their pajamas at home
set up perfect lighting, a clean background, and crisp audio —
and they got the callback.
The virtual interview is a technical performance.
And you are performing at standard today.
Full standard. No excuses.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Percussion steady. Focused and intentional.]

Here is the virtual interview problem that nobody talks about.
Your energy reads at fifty percent on camera.
If you feel fully engaged, the camera shows half that.
If you feel mildly engaged, the camera shows almost nothing.
The screen compresses your presence.
So you must amplify without becoming theatrical.
Louder voice. Bigger eye contact — which means looking at the CAMERA, not the screen.
More deliberate nodding. Cleaner pauses.
You are not performing. You are compensating for the medium.
Every professional broadcaster knows this.
They are not their natural selves on camera.
They are their amplified professional selves.
That is what you bring to this camera today.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Synth builds with purposeful energy.]

Here is your three-step virtual interview command protocol.
Protocol: Environment. Energy. Execute.

Step one is to master your ENVIRONMENT before the call starts.
Do this now — before the interview.
Camera at eye level. Not below. Eye level.
Light source in FRONT of you, not behind.
A window in front of you or a ring light. Both work.
Never have a window or bright lamp behind you.
That makes you a silhouette. Silhouettes don't get hired.
Your background is clean. Minimal. Not a pile of laundry.
Test your internet. Plug in with ethernet if possible.
Audio — headphones or a quality mic, never laptop speakers.
These are not preferences. They are standards.
Set them up in the next sixty minutes.

Step two is to dial in your ENERGY before you join the call.
Do not go directly from watching television to a virtual interview.
Five minutes before you join — stand up.
Move. Shake your hands out. Say your name and headline out loud.
"My name is [name] and I bring [value] to this conversation."
Twice. Say it twice. Your voice needs to warm up.
When you join the call, your FIRST impression is your energy.
Before you say a single word about your experience,
they have already formed their first impression.
Make it: present, warm, professionally energized.

Step three is to EXECUTE the technical interview disciplines.
Look at the camera, not at their face on the screen.
Camera eye contact feels direct on their end.
Face watching feels evasive on their end.
When you are answering a long question, check the camera every ten seconds.
Nod more than you think you need to. It shows active listening.
Speak slightly louder and more slowly than in person.
The medium compresses your pace. Intentional slowness helps.
Keep a glass of water nearby. Dry mouth is real in virtual formats.

If technical issues arise, then name them immediately.
"I'm experiencing some lag on my end — can you hear me clearly?"
Addressing it directly is professional. Ignoring it is awkward.

If you feel disconnected from the interviewer, then lean forward slightly.
And ask: "I want to make sure I'm addressing what matters most to you.
Am I on the right track?"
That question re-establishes connection.

If nerves cause you to rush, then physically slow your hands.
Place them in your lap and breathe. Your pace will follow.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Synth settles to focused clean groove.]

See yourself on that screen right now.
Your light is perfect. Your background is clean. Your audio is crisp.
You look directly into the camera. You are present.
They ask a question. You breathe. You answer clearly.
Hear your voice — warm, amplified, professional.
Feel the command of someone who treated this medium seriously.

I am the professional who performs at full standard in any format.
Virtual or in-person, I bring the same presence.
I am prepared. My environment is controlled.
I own this screen. Let's go.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Percussion drives to a clean, decisive finish.]

Right now — check your camera height. Check your light source.
Say your name and value out loud twice.
Stand up. Move for two minutes. Then join the call.

I am fully present in every format I show up in.
My camera is my stage. And I own it.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a crisp, focused instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a tight electronic percussion pattern and a clean synth lead — precise, professional, no excess. At forty seconds, add a driving bass synth that gives the track backbone and forward momentum. At one minute forty seconds, the arrangement is in full performance mode — clean and energized without chaos. At three minutes ten seconds, strip to percussion and a single synth lead — like a performer locking in for the final section. At three fifty-five, a clean decisive resolution. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: technical precision, screen presence, professional amplification. Style: modern electronic motivational, clean and direct. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow push into a perfectly lit home studio or workspace setup — clean background, ring light glow visible in reflection, a screen showing abstract geometric light. The camera advances steadily toward the screen, as if approaching from the interviewee's perspective. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: cool white, ring light warm glow, deep charcoal background, blue screen reflections. Loop strategy: camera advances toward the screen glow, then eases back in a palindrome — approach and return, seamless. Atmosphere: virtual presence, professional command, technical readiness. Loopable with no jump cuts.
