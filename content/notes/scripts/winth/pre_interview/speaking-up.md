=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Driving percussion. Sharp and immediate.]

Breathe in hard. Right now. All the way.
Now exhale fast. Do it again.
In. Out. Good.

Let me ask you something direct.
How many times have you had an answer — a REAL answer —
and sat on it because you weren't sure it was good enough?
How many rooms have you been in where you knew something
but let someone else say an inferior version of it first?
And then you thought: I should have said that.
I HAD that.
Listen to me. The moment you don't say the thing —
THAT moment costs you.
Not eventually. Not maybe. RIGHT THEN.
We stop losing those moments today. Right now.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Percussion steady. Focused energy.]

Here is the speaking up problem in professional settings.
Most people believe they need certainty before they speak.
"I need to be sure before I raise my hand."
"I need to have a fully formed argument before I share my view."
But here is what happens while you wait for certainty.
The conversation moves. The opening closes.
Someone else speaks — with less certainty than you had —
and gets the credit, the visibility, the momentum.
The bar for speaking is not certainty.
The bar for speaking is RELEVANCE.
If you have something relevant, you have the right to speak.
Not just the right — the responsibility.
Because organizations that silence their relevant voices
make worse decisions. And you are a relevant voice.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Percussion builds. Urgent, purposeful, clear.]

Here is your three-step speaking up activation protocol.
Protocol: Prepare. Claim. Deliver.

Step one is to PREPARE your voice before the meeting starts.
Before any high-stakes meeting, write down one thing you know.
One thing you've observed. One perspective that is genuinely yours.
It does not need to be extraordinary.
"Based on what I saw with the Q three data,
there's something worth flagging before we commit to this direction."
That sentence is not genius. It is contribution.
And contribution spoken beats genius silent.
Write the sentence before the meeting. Have it ready.

Step two is to CLAIM your spot in the conversation proactively.
Do not wait for a perfect pause. Create your entry point.
"I'd like to add something to this."
"Before we move on — I want to raise one consideration."
"I want to go back to the point about X for a moment."
These entry phrases are speech acts of confidence.
They say: I am here. I have something. It is worth the room's time.
You do not need permission to say them. You claim the space.
And here is the truth — most people in that room WANT someone to guide the conversation.
They just don't want to be the one to do it.
You do it. You take the lead.

Step three is to DELIVER your point with economy and precision.
When you have the floor — use it efficiently.
Make your point. Support it with one piece of evidence.
Stop. That is it.
"My concern is X. In Q two we saw Y, which suggests X is relevant here.
That's the piece I wanted to surface."
Twenty seconds. One idea. One evidence point. Full stop.
People remember the speaker who is crisp.
People stop listening to the speaker who goes long.

If your voice cracks or shakes when you start, then push through.
The second sentence is always steadier than the first.
The third sentence sounds like you own the room.

If someone dismisses your point, then stand by it.
"I hear you. I want to make sure the consideration is on the table."
Then let it be. You said it. It is now in the room.

If you are in a remote meeting, then use the raise-hand feature.
Or type in chat. Or simply say "I want to jump in here."
Format does not limit voice. Only silence does.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Percussion softens to a focused, tight groove.]

See yourself in that meeting or conversation right now.
You have the thought. You breathe. You speak.
"I want to add one thing here."
The room shifts slightly toward you.
You say your point clearly. Twenty seconds. Done.
Hear your voice — steady, relevant, present.
Feel the momentum of someone who spoke before the moment passed.

I am the professional who brings my voice to every table I sit at.
I prepare. I claim my space. I deliver with precision.
I do not wait until the moment is perfect. I make the moment mine.
My voice shapes rooms. I use it.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Percussion drives to a decisive, clear finish.]

Right now, write one thing you know that is relevant to your next conversation.
One sentence. Then practice saying it out loud. Once.
That is your activation.

I speak when I have something to say.
The moment is now. Say it.
Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a driving, urgent instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a sharp synth hit and immediate tight percussion — no buildup, just in. At thirty seconds, add a bass synth that creates forward motion and urgency without chaos. At one minute forty seconds, full arrangement at peak intensity — controlled, fast, purposeful. At three minutes ten seconds, strip back to percussion and a clean synth accent — ready to act. At three fifty-five, a final sharp hit and a clean close. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: urgent action, speak-now energy, lost-moment prevention. Style: hip-hop influenced, sharp, driven. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A quick push forward through a sleek modern meeting room — empty chairs around a glass table, overhead recessed lighting, clean lines. The camera advances with purpose and direction, as if moving to claim a seat. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: cool grey, polished glass, white walls, a single bold accent color — electric blue or red — in a design element. Loop strategy: camera advances to the table's near edge, then seamlessly cuts back to the room entrance — repeating the claim. Atmosphere: decisive entry, claimed space, vocal presence. Loopable with no jump cuts.
