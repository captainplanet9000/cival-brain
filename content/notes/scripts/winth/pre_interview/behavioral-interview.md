=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Strong synth. Controlled energy.]

One breath. In. Out.
Ready.

A behavioral interview is not a test of what you know.
It is a test of what you have DONE.
And the beautiful thing about what you have done
is that it cannot be taken from you.
It happened. It is yours. It is true.
The behavioral question — "Tell me about a time when..."
is an invitation to prove yourself with evidence.
Not theory. Not what you would do.
What you DID. Real. Specific. Yours.
This is the format where preparation produces the most immediate return.
Because the person who has their stories ready
walks circles around the person who is searching live.
We prepare the stories right now.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Synth steady. Crisp and focused.]

Here is why behavioral interviews go wrong for prepared people.
They know the STAR method. They understand the structure.
But they tell their story like a report, not like a narrative.
Situation — flat. Task — flat. Action — listed. Result — stated.
The evaluator gets the information but not the experience.
And the experience is what creates trust.
"That candidate answered correctly" does not get you hired.
"That candidate took me into the room where it happened" gets you hired.
The structure is not the story.
The structure is the skeleton. The story is the muscle.
You need both. Most candidates only bring the skeleton.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Synth and percussion build with narrative precision.]

Here is your three-step behavioral story preparation protocol.
Protocol: STAR Plus Dimension.

The base is STAR — Situation. Task. Action. Result.
You know this. But let's add three performance dimensions that elevate it.

Dimension one is STAKES. Add one sentence on what was at risk.
Before you describe the action, name the stakes.
"The project was three weeks from a client deadline.
If we missed, we stood to lose a two-year contract."
Now the evaluator is engaged. There is tension.
Without stakes, a story is just a sequence of events.
Stakes make it a story.

Dimension two is INNER PROCESS. Add one sentence on what you thought or decided.
"I had two options. Risk the timeline or reduce the scope.
I decided that scope reduction was more respectful to the client than a missed deadline."
That inner process sentence does something powerful.
It reveals how you think. Under pressure. In real time.
Hiring decisions are made on judgment. Show the judgment.

Dimension three is REFLECTION. Add one sentence on what you would do differently.
"If I were doing it again, I would involve the client in the scope decision earlier.
Their input would have saved two revision cycles."
Reflection signals self-awareness and ongoing learning.
It also signals intellectual honesty. You are not just right. You are improving.

Now the STAR structure with these three dimensions is a real story.
Situation with stakes. Task with context. Action with inner process.
Result with reflection.
That is the standard. That is what gets you remembered.

For behavioral interviews, prepare five stories in advance.
Each story should be usable for multiple question types.
A leadership story. A conflict story. A failure story.
A collaboration story. A results story.
Write them. Practice them out loud once each.
Not to memorize. To make the language fluent.

If you blank on a question, then say: "Give me two seconds to access a specific example."
Then access it. Do not fill dead air with "ums" and "I think."
Two seconds of intentional silence is professional.

If your best examples are older, then do not apologize for them.
"This is a few years back but it is the clearest example of this specific skill."
Own the example fully. Vintage does not diminish quality.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Synth softens to a clear melodic line.]

See yourself in that behavioral interview right now.
They ask: "Tell me about a time you led through uncertainty."
You have the story ready. You open with the stakes.
You trace the action with the inner process.
You land on the result and close with the reflection.
Hear your voice — paced, vivid, precise.
Feel the confidence of someone whose stories are built and ready.

I am the candidate who brings evidence, not just answers.
My stories are specific, vivid, and fully mine.
I bring the evaluator into the room where it happened.
Every behavioral question is an opportunity to prove what I already know.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Synth resolves to a clean, precise finish.]

Write the headline of one behavioral story right now.
Include the stakes in one sentence.
Practice saying it out loud with that sentence included.
The story with stakes is a different story entirely.

I have my stories. They are real. They are ready.
Behavioral interviews are where I shine.
Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a narrative-driven, precise instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a synth that enters like the beginning of a compelling story — one strong note, then a melody that unfolds with intention. At forty seconds, percussion enters with structure and momentum. At one minute forty seconds, the arrangement builds to its narrative peak — rich, dimensional, vivid. At three minutes ten seconds, reduce to the core melody with clean rhythm — the conclusion landing clearly. At three fifty-five, a satisfying narrative resolution. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: evidence-based confidence, narrative precision, story as proof. Style: modern cinematic motivational, story register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A forward push through a sequence of distinct visual moments — an office at night, a meeting room, a finished product — each scene briefly visible through a window or glass wall, as if walking past chapters of a story. The camera advances steadily forward through these moments. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: warm interior light through glass, cool exterior contrast, story-chapter progression. Loop strategy: camera advances through the sequence of glass-framed scenes, then seamlessly resets to the first — chapters repeating. Atmosphere: evidence of real work, story chapters, lived experience. Loopable with no jump cuts.
