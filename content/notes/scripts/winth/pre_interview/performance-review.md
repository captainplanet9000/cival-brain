=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Strong uplifting synth. Controlled energy from the start.]

Take one breath. Sharp. Clear.
Now set your standard before you walk in.

A performance review is not a passive event.
It is not something that happens to you.
It is something you execute.
Most people walk into a performance review underprepared.
They wait to hear what the manager thinks.
They react. They adjust. They shrink or defend.
You are not doing that today.
You are walking in as the architect of this conversation.
You have the data. You have the narrative. You have the standard.
And you are going in to own the record.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Synth steady. Crisp and driving.]

Here is the performance review problem.
Your manager sees a fraction of what you did this year.
A fraction. The projects they heard about.
The wins that made it into the right meetings.
Not the daily acts of excellence that never got announced.
Not the problem you solved at eleven at night.
Not the relationship you repaired. The process you improved.
The default is that your manager fills the gaps with assumptions.
And the assumptions are based on what they saw — not what you did.
The performance review is your chance to fill those gaps.
With evidence. With precision. With your standard.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Synth and percussion build to clear, structured energy.]

Here is your three-step performance review protocol.
Protocol: Build. Frame. Set.

Step one is to BUILD your performance dossier before you walk in.
Write down every significant accomplishment this review period.
Every project, every result, every measurable improvement.
Then select your top five. Rank them by business impact.
For each one: what was the situation, what did you do, what was the result.
Now you have a dossier. Bring it. Reference it.
Not because you need it. Because it shows the standard you operate at.

Step two is to FRAME the conversation before they set the frame.
Do not wait for them to open with their observations.
Open with yours. With confidence. With data.
"I want to start by sharing five highlights from this review period."
You are not bragging. You are presenting.
This is what high performers do. They own the narrative.
If the manager's frame does not match your evidence, you correct it.
Politely. Precisely. With data.
"I want to make sure the record is complete.
Here is what happened on that project specifically."

Step three is to SET your next milestone clearly.
The performance review is also an investment conversation.
It is your chance to align on what growth looks like next.
At the close: "Here are three goals I am committing to next period.
And here is what I need from the organization to achieve them."
This signals initiative. It signals ownership. It signals ambition.
Managers promote people who make their job easier.
That sentence makes their job easier.

If the manager raises criticism, then listen completely before responding.
Take one breath. Say: "Thank you for that feedback.
Here is my response to that specific point."
Stay on the specific point. Do not generalize.

If ratings feel lower than your performance, then present your evidence.
Calmly. Specifically. Without emotion.
"Based on these five outcomes, I believe the rating should reflect X."
Data is the language. Speak it fluently.

If the conversation stalls on subjective feedback, then anchor on outcomes.
"I understand the perception. Here are the results."
Results are real. Results are yours.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Synth softens to clear, bright tone.]

See yourself in that review meeting right now.
Your dossier is in hand. You are composed.
You open the conversation. You lead with your evidence.
Hear your voice — steady, clear, measured.
The manager is nodding. They are hearing your standard.
Feel the control of someone who owns their performance record.

I am the professional who measures and owns my performance.
I bring evidence, not just effort.
I set the standard and then I meet it.
My performance review is a conversation I lead.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Synth resolves to a clear, bright close.]

Right now, write five accomplishments from this review period.
For each one: situation, action, result. Three sentences.
That is your dossier. Walk in with it today.

I own my performance record.
I present with evidence and set the next standard.
The record speaks. I make sure it speaks correctly.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a precise, high-energy instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a strong synth lead and driving percussion — controlled intensity from the first beat. At forty-five seconds, add layers of synth texture and a bass line that gives the track structure and momentum. At one minute forty seconds, the full arrangement plays at peak clarity — crisp, forward-moving, and purposeful. At three minutes ten seconds, strip to a bright synth melody and tight percussion — like a final sprint with focus. At three fifty-five, a clean, satisfying resolution. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: high performance, precision focus, data-driven energy. Style: modern cinematic motivational, uplifting synth. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A forward tracking shot along a sleek data dashboard or abstract visualization surface — clean numbers and lines flowing past at a measured pace, rendered abstractly so no specific text is readable. The camera tracks steadily forward through this data environment. The center frame is clean and open for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: electric blue, clean white, deep navy, bright data-green accents. Loop strategy: forward tracking through the data surface with a seamless cut back to start — data always flowing forward. Atmosphere: precision performance, measurable achievement, data ownership. Loopable with no jump cuts.
