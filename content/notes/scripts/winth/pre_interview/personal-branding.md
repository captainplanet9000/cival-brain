=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft acoustic guitar. Warm and open.]

Take a breath in. Hold it gently.
And release. Fully. All the way out.
Once more.

Your personal brand is not a marketing strategy.
It is not a content calendar.
It is not a curated version of yourself designed to impress.
Your personal brand is your story.
The real one. The actual thread that runs through your choices,
your skills, your direction, and your values.
When that story is clear to you —
clearly enough that you can say it in sixty seconds —
everything changes.
Interviews feel different. Networking feels different.
People say: "I know exactly what you bring."
Because you told them. Simply. Genuinely. Memorably.
That is the brand we build today.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Guitar continues, warm and unhurried.]

Here is the personal branding challenge that most professionals face.
They think the brand needs to be aspirational.
"I need to position myself as a thought leader."
"I need a niche. A lane. A signature topic."
And so they try to construct something external.
Something they think sounds impressive.
And it falls flat because it is not actually theirs.

The brand that resonates is always the one that is true.
The professional who says:
"I build trust in organizations that are going through hard transitions.
That is what I am best at and it is what I love doing most."
That person does not need to convince anyone of their brand.
It is already believed. Because it came from a real place.
Your brand is already inside you.
We are not building something new.
We are finding the words for what is already true.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters, warm and supportive.]

Here is your three-step personal brand clarity plan.
Plan: Root. Articulate. Embody.

Step one is to find the ROOT of your brand in your actual history.
Ask yourself: what have I been asked to do again and again?
What do colleagues seek me out for?
What kind of problem do I solve best — and love solving?
Write down your answers. Do not edit them.
Then look for the pattern.
Most people who do this exercise discover they have been doing the same work —
at its core — for most of their career.
The form changes. The core stays.
That core is your brand.

Step two is to ARTICULATE your brand in a clear, spoken sentence.
Not a bio. A sentence.
"I am the person who translates technical complexity into clear human decisions."
"I build high-performing teams in environments that have lost their direction."
"I am the connector — I find the overlap between business goals and human needs."
That sentence should feel both accurate and slightly surprising.
Like someone reading your own mail.
Write five drafts. Read them out loud.
The one that makes you nod is the real one. Use that.

Step three is to EMBODY the brand in how you show up, not just what you say.
Your personal brand is not your bio. It is your behavior.
If you say your brand is "building trust through transparency" —
do you offer honest assessments when people ask?
Do you say things that are uncomfortable and true?
The brand lives in the action.
The most powerful personal brands belong to the people
who do not need to announce them.
Others announce it for them.
"You should talk to her — she always tells you the real thing."
That is a brand. Built by behavior. Not by content.

If you are unsure what your brand is, then ask three trusted colleagues.
"If someone asked you to describe what I am best at,
what would you say?"
The answers will surprise you. And often, they will align.

If your brand feels smaller than your ambition, then remember.
The most specific brands are the most powerful ones.
"I'm good at business" is not a brand.
"I build the financial models that help early-stage founders make their first raise" is.
Specific is memorable. Specific is referrable. Specific is you.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens. Guitar alone, warm and close.]

Picture yourself in a conversation where someone asks: "So what do you do?"
And instead of stumbling, you say your sentence.
Clear. True. Yours.
They look at you with recognition.
"Oh — I know someone you should meet."
Hear your voice as you say it — grounded, genuine, exactly yourself.
Feel the freedom of no longer needing to prove what you already are.

I am the person whose brand is their story.
My story is specific, real, and mine.
I do not need to perform my brand. I live it.
Every room I enter, my brand walks in with me.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Guitar fades to a single warm held note.]

Write your brand sentence right now. Just one sentence.
Start with: "I am the person who ___."
Read it out loud. Feel if it is true.
If it is — that is your brand. Say it clearly today.

I know my brand. I live my story.
And I tell it in a way that only I can.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a warm, self-discovering instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a single acoustic guitar melody — honest and searching, like someone finding their own voice. At forty seconds, a light piano joins with warmth and clarity — the harmony of recognizing something true. At one minute forty seconds, a gentle cello enters below — grounding the moment with authenticity. At three minutes ten seconds, return to guitar alone — intimate, genuine, complete. At three fifty-five, a final honest resolving phrase. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: self-recognition, authentic story, found voice. Style: acoustic folk-chamber, introspective warmth. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, intimate drift through a personal workspace — a cork board with pinned items, a handwritten notebook open, warm side lamp, meaningful personal objects. The camera drifts slowly and warmly through the space, discovering rather than surveying. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: warm amber lamp, cream white paper, natural wood, soft shadow. Loop strategy: camera drifts across the space in a gentle exploratory arc, returning warmly to start — cyclic discovery. Atmosphere: personal story, authentic identity, genuine self-knowledge. Loopable with no jump cuts.
