=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Low resonant piano. Commanding and still.]

Breathe in slowly. Four measured counts.
Hold. Two counts. Release.
One more time.

You are preparing to sit at the highest table.
Not metaphorically. The actual executive table.
And the rules are different there.
Longer tenure. Higher stakes. Fewer words.
C-suite conversations happen at a different altitude.
They are not about the details. They are about the direction.
They are not about what happened. They are about what it means.
Prepare to operate at that altitude right now.
Not because you are performing it.
But because you have thought at that level long enough to inhabit it.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues. Deliberate and precise.]

Here is the C-suite meeting trap.
Most people bring operational thinking to a strategic conversation.
They walk in with feature details when the executive wants market positioning.
They present process metrics when the executive wants business outcomes.
The executive team does not run the machine. They set the direction of the machine.
If you speak to them like an operator, they will see you as an operator.
If you speak to them like a strategist, they will see you as a peer.

The second trap is over-explaining.
Every extra word in an executive conversation is a confidence leak.
"So basically what we were trying to do was sort of move in the direction of..."
That sentence costs you credibility in the first fifteen words.
Executives speak in conclusions. They trust in brevity.
Your sentences are short. Your points are clear. Your silence is deliberate.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Strings enter. Structured, dignified, precise.]

Here is your three-step C-suite conversation framework.
Framework: Altitude. Economy. Ask.

Step one is to operate at the right ALTITUDE throughout.
Before you enter, ask yourself: what is the strategic question here?
Not the operational answer. The strategic question.
"The real question facing this decision is how we want to position in the market."
"The core issue is whether we prioritize speed or durability of growth."
Frame your input at the level of direction and consequence.
Every time you feel pulled toward the detail, pull back up.
"I have the operational detail available if useful.
My strategic read is X."
That one sentence puts you at the right altitude.

Step two is to practice ECONOMY of language.
Write your key points before you go in. Maximum three.
For each point: one headline sentence and one supporting fact.
That is it. Not a paragraph. One headline. One fact.
If they want more, they will ask.
Executives who want more will always ask.
If they do not ask, the headline was enough.
Brevity with precision is the mark of executive thinking.

Step three is to CLOSE with a clear ask or recommendation.
Never leave a C-suite meeting without naming next steps.
"I am recommending we move forward on X.
The decision I need from this room is Y.
Timeline: I need that decision by Z."
Executives respect other decision-makers.
If you make a clear ask, you signal that you belong here.

If an executive challenges your data, then respond economically.
"The data comes from X. My confidence level in that source is high."
One sentence. Then let them respond.

If you do not know something, then say exactly that.
"I don't have that information in front of me.
I will get it to you by end of day."
Not knowing is fine. Pretending to know is disqualifying.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens to a spare, dignified piano line.]

See yourself at that executive table right now.
Your posture is grounded. Your voice is measured.
You offer your strategic read. Brief. Precise.
The room acknowledges it. The conversation deepens.
Hear your own voice — low, unhurried, certain.
Feel the weight and calm of someone who belongs at this table.

I am the executive who speaks at altitude and listens with depth.
I bring strategy, not detail, unless detail is required.
I close with a clear ask. I belong at this table.
This room is where I operate. I am operating.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano closes with a single deliberate note.]

Write your three headline points for this meeting right now.
One headline. One supporting fact. Per point.
Practice saying them aloud without adding extra words.

I speak at the level this room requires.
I am ready for the highest table.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a commanding, sparse instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a single deep piano note — deliberate, unhurried, like a decision forming. At thirty seconds, a low string section enters with restraint — dignified, not warm, precise. At one minute forty seconds, piano and strings reach a controlled apex — high-altitude authority, nothing excessive. At three minutes ten seconds, reduce to piano alone — a single strategic line, certain and clear. At three fifty-five, a resolute final chord. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: executive altitude, strategic authority, controlled power. Style: modern orchestral, boardroom register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, deliberate push into the center of an empty executive boardroom — the head of the table, high windows overlooking a skyline, architectural lighting casting clean shadows. The camera advances at a measured, intentional pace — this is the room where things are decided. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: dark mahogany, polished glass, deep grey, cool skyline light. Loop strategy: camera advances to the head of the table, holds at the power position briefly, then seamlessly resets to the room entrance — repeating the approach. Atmosphere: executive altitude, strategic weight, decisive authority. Loopable with no jump cuts.
