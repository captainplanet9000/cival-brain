=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft piano. Steady and measured.]

Breathe in. Hold for four. Release.
Once more. In. Hold. And out.

There is a question that few candidates are asked
but every great hiring manager thinks about.
"If this person starts on Monday — what happens in the first ninety days?"
Not the first year. Not the next decade.
The first ninety days.
Because ninety days is when the new hire either
builds trust, demonstrates judgment, and creates early wins —
or drifts, waits for direction, and misses the window.
The ninety-day plan is not bureaucratic.
It is the clearest signal of how you think
about preparation, impact, and professional maturity.
Having one is exceptional. Having a good one is rare.
We build yours right now.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues, warm and measured.]

Here is what most new hires do in their first ninety days.
They observe. They orient. They wait.
"I'm still learning the environment."
"I don't want to overstep before I understand the culture."
Both of those instincts are understandable.
But both of them, unchecked, create a problem.
The environment begins to form an impression of you
based on your presence and your contributions.
If your presence is passive for thirty days,
that impression calcifies quickly.
Quiet new hires become invisible employees.
And invisible employees do not get the next project.
They do not get the next promotion.

The best new hires understand that learning and contributing are simultaneous.
You do not wait until you know everything to add value.
You add value at the level of what you know right now.
And that practice accelerates the learning exponentially.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters beneath piano. Warm, purposeful.]

Here is your three-phase ninety-day plan structure.
Structure: Learn. Contribute. Lead.

Phase one is days one through thirty — LEARN.
In this phase your primary job is to understand the environment.
Meet every key stakeholder. Ask the same set of questions to each.
"What is working well that I should protect?
What is the biggest challenge I should understand?
What would success look like for you with someone in my role?"
Those three questions, asked to each stakeholder, build your map.
Also identify the three most important priorities in the role.
Not your twenty-point task list. The three priorities.
What moves the needle. What cannot slip. What earns trust fastest.
Write them down. Show them to your manager. Confirm them.

Phase two is days thirty-one through sixty — CONTRIBUTE.
In this phase you activate on the priorities.
Pick one visible project. Deliver something specific by day sixty.
It does not need to be large. It needs to be done well.
"By day sixty, I have completed X.
That delivers Y to the team."
A delivered commitment in month two is worth more
than a month of orientation.
It says: this person executes. This person delivers.

Phase three is days sixty-one through ninety — LEAD.
In this phase you begin to extend your influence.
Propose something. Identify a gap and bring a suggestion.
"Based on what I have seen in the first sixty days,
I'd like to propose addressing X.
Here is my initial thinking on the approach."
That one proposal signals that you are not just executing.
You are thinking about the environment and improving it.
That transition — from doer to contributor to improver —
happens in ninety days when it is intentional.

If you are sharing a ninety-day plan in an interview, then be specific.
Not "I plan to meet stakeholders and learn the culture."
"By day thirty, I will have met the twelve key stakeholders.
By day sixty, I will have completed my first project.
By day ninety, I will have proposed one process improvement."
Specificity signals serious intent.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Piano and cello soften. Warm and resolved.]

See yourself ninety days in.
The team has noticed your consistency.
Your manager knows they made the right choice.
You have delivered one clear win and proposed one thoughtful idea.
Hear your voice in that ninety-day review — specific, calm, grounded.
Feel the satisfaction of someone who executed a deliberate plan.

I am the professional who arrives with a plan and executes it.
I learn and contribute simultaneously.
I build trust through consistent delivery.
My ninety days are intentional. I am intentional.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano resolves. A single warm, clear note.]

Right now, write three goals for your first ninety days.
Learn. Contribute. Propose.
One for each phase. Specific enough to measure.

I am ready. I have the plan.
The first ninety days are already in motion.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a measured, purposeful instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a steady piano line — grounded, forward-moving, like a person with a clear plan. At forty seconds, a cello enters below with philosophical depth — the wisdom of taking the long view. At one minute forty seconds, both instruments develop with building clarity — each phrase completing the previous, like phases of a plan executing. At three minutes, soften to piano alone — clean, resolved, purposeful. At three fifty-five, a final settled phrase fades to quiet confidence. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: deliberate planning, professional maturity, grounded forward motion. Style: acoustic chamber, mentorship register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, deliberate forward drift down an empty but organized workspace corridor — clean shelves, morning light, a sense of order and intent. The camera moves at a steady, purposeful pace. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: warm wood, clean white, morning light gold, organized grey. Loop strategy: camera advances down the corridor to a clean end point, then eases back — palindrome, purposeful and measured. Atmosphere: professional planning, deliberate action, organized intent. Loopable with no jump cuts.

=== LIBRARY PAIRING OPTIONS ===
Primary Match:
- Visual: Organized Workspace Corridor Purposeful Advance
  - Why: Planned, organized environment matches 90-day plan calm_mentor deliberate structure theme
  - Alternative: Library Stacks Slow Walk — same deliberate forward motion, more contemplative

- Music: Piano and Cello — Deliberate Plan
  - Why: Measured piano with philosophical cello mirrors three-phase plan structure at 92 BPM
  - Alternative: Solo Piano — Blueprint Clarity (more spare, equally grounded)

New Custom Prompts:
- Use the Suno and Higgsfield prompts above
- Tailored to ninety-day plan calm_mentor structure framework
- Both follow all ASMPro format requirements
