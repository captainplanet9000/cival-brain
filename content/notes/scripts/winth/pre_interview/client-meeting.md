=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Driving percussion. Immediate focus.]

Stop. Breathe. Right now. Hard.
All the way in. Now out.

Let me ask you something directly.
Do you know why this client is in that room with you today?
Not just the meeting agenda. The REAL reason.
They have a problem that is costing them time.
They have a gap that is costing them money.
They have pressure from above, from below, from the market.
And they are sitting down with YOU because they believe
you might be the person who can help solve it.
That is a gift. Do not treat it like a PowerPoint delivery.
Treat it like a trust-building moment.
Because it is.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Percussion steady. Energy focused.]

Here is what kills client meetings before they start.
Walking in with the solution before you understand the problem.
"Let me tell you about our product" before you ask one question.
That approach tells the client one thing:
"I am here for my agenda. Not yours."
And once a client feels that, the meeting is already over.
You are just going through the motions until they can leave.

The second meeting killer is running the clock on your slides
and leaving no time for conversation.
A client who talks in your meeting buys in your meeting.
A client who listens in your meeting is just attending.
Make them talk. Make them feel heard.
That is where the deal lives.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Percussion builds. Purposeful and direct.]

Here is your three-step client meeting command protocol.
Protocol: Diagnose. Connect. Commit.

Step one is to DIAGNOSE before you present.
Open with two or three well-prepared questions.
Questions that show you did the research.
"I noticed your team expanded significantly last quarter.
How is that affecting your current process?"
"Your competitors are moving toward X. What's your position on that?"
These questions do two things simultaneously.
They show preparation — which builds credibility.
And they surface the real pain — which tells you what to solve.
You do not present until you have diagnosed.
Even if that delays your slides by fifteen minutes.
The diagnosis IS the meeting.

Step two is to CONNECT your solution to their pain explicitly.
Not "here is what we do." "Here is exactly how this solves what you just described."
After they name the problem, you name the solution to THAT problem.
"You said the onboarding process is taking twelve weeks.
Our implementation cuts that to five. Here's how."
The solution only matters when it is attached to their pain.
Make that connection explicit. Say it out loud.
Never assume they see the connection. Name it.

Step three is to COMMIT to a next step before you leave.
Every client meeting ends with ambiguity unless you drive the next step.
"Based on our conversation, I am proposing a follow-up call next Thursday.
I will send a one-page proposal by Wednesday at noon.
Does that work for you?"
Specific. Dated. Committed.
If they say yes, you have a deal in progress.
If they pause, you learn what the real obstacle is.
Either way, you win.

If the client goes off-topic, then follow them briefly.
Then bring it back: "That connects to what we discussed earlier — let's stay on that."
If they challenge your pricing or scope, then pause before responding.
Then say: "Tell me more about the constraint there."
Understand before you respond.
If a key decision-maker is absent from the room, then ask.
"Is there anyone else we should loop in before we finalize direction?"
Name the obstacle. Don't pretend it doesn't exist.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Percussion softens to a focused groove.]

See yourself in that client meeting right now.
You open with a diagnostic question. They lean forward.
They are sharing the real problem. You are listening fully.
Then you connect your solution directly to what they said.
Their expression shifts. They see the value.
Hear your voice — direct, confident, client-focused.
Feel the energy of someone who came prepared to serve, not just sell.

I am the professional who shows up for the client's problem.
I diagnose before I present.
I connect solutions to real pain.
I close every meeting with a committed next step.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Driving music to a decisive finish.]

Right now, write two diagnostic questions for this meeting.
Questions that show you researched their situation.
Then write your closing next-step sentence.
Say it out loud. Mean it.

I show up for the client. I deliver real value.
I close with commitment. Let's go.

At forty-five seconds, a melodic synth layer enters with warmth and direction. At one minute forty seconds, the full arrangement delivers controlled energy — professional urgency, like a meeting gaining momentum. At three minutes, strip to percussion and bass with a clean synth accent — decisive and closing. At three fifty-five, a confident final phrase and fade. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: client-service urgency, professional confidence, purposeful delivery. Style: modern motivational, urban professional. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A purposeful forward advance through a bright, modern conference room toward a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking a business district — the city visible and alive below. The camera advances toward the window at a confident, deliberate pace. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: clean white, cool glass, warm city light, polished surface reflections. Loop strategy: forward advance to the window view, then eases back — palindrome seamless and intentional. Atmosphere: client trust, purposeful service, professional delivery. Loopable with no jump cuts.
