=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Low resonant piano. Dignified and measured.]

Breathe in slowly. Four counts.
Hold. Two counts. Release.
Again.

A board room is not a classroom.
You are not there to teach.
You are not there to impress.
You are there to inform, advise, and lead.
And the most powerful thing you bring into that room
is not your slides or your data.
It is the clarity with which you hold your position.
We prepare that clarity now.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues. Structured, even tempo.]

Here is where board presentations break down.
The presenter over-indexes on slide content.
They narrate data that board members can read.
They explain context the board already has.
They try to cover everything instead of controlling the frame.
Board members are experienced decision-makers.
They do not need information. They need insight.
The question they are asking throughout your entire presentation is:
"Does this person understand what matters most?"
That is the only question. Answer it first.

If your presentation does not answer that question
in the first two minutes, attention begins to drift.
And once board attention drifts, it rarely fully returns.
You lead with the insight. Everything else supports it.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Strings enter under piano. Structured and authoritative.]

Here is your three-step board presence framework.
Framework: Lead. Support. Decide.

Step one is to LEAD with your conclusion.
Do not build to your main point like a mystery novel.
Board members are not waiting for a reveal.
State your recommendation in the first ninety seconds.
"The data shows X. I recommend Y. Here is why."
Three sentences. That is your opening.
Everything after that is support, not new information.
This is called the inverted pyramid. Journalism uses it.
Executives require it.

Step two is to SUPPORT with three ordered pillars.
After your opening recommendation, present your three pillars.
Each pillar is one argument supporting your recommendation.
Lead each pillar with a single sentence conclusion.
"Pillar one: the financial data supports this decision."
Then the evidence. Then move to pillar two.
Keep each pillar under two minutes of verbal presentation.
Board members track structure. Give them clear structure.

Step three is to DECIDE openly by naming your next step.
Do not end with "any questions?"
End with: "My recommendation is X.
I am asking for a decision on Y by Z date.
Here is what happens next if we move forward."
That close signals executive thinking.
You are not just presenting a problem. You are leading through it.

If a board member interrupts with a challenge, then welcome it.
Say: "That is a fair challenge. Here is how I think about it."
Do not defend. Engage. Board challenges are invitations to lead.

If you feel the room questioning your authority, then slow down.
Speed is a tell for insecurity. Measured pace signals conviction.

If data is questioned, then say: "I am confident in this data.
Here is the source and here is the margin of consideration."
One sentence. Then move forward.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Piano and strings soften. Clear and dignified.]

See yourself standing at the head of that room.
The board is seated. You have the floor.
You open with your recommendation. Clear. Decisive. Brief.
They are listening. Some lean forward.
Hear your voice — low, measured, utterly controlled.
Feel the quiet authority of someone who has prepared precisely.

I am the executive who leads with clarity in any room.
I present insight, not information.
I bring recommendations, not just data.
The board listens because I give them reason to.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano resolves. Single dignified note. Fades.]

Right now, write your opening three sentences.
Your recommendation. Your evidence headline. Your ask.
Practice them once. Stand up while you say them.
That is how you walk in today.

I lead with clarity. I earn authority through preparation.
The room responds to what I bring. I bring excellence.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a dignified, structured instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Begin with a single low piano chord — authoritative and measured. At thirty seconds, a restrained string section enters with clean precision — nothing flamboyant, everything purposeful. At one minute forty seconds, the composition reaches its fullest expression — structured, controlled, like a decision being made at the highest level. At three minutes ten seconds, reduce to piano and a single cello — spare and resolved. At three fifty-five, close with a final authoritative piano phrase. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: commanding authority, executive precision, earned leadership. Style: modern orchestral chamber, boardroom register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow advance through a high-ceiling boardroom — the head of the table approaches, polished wood surface, leather chairs, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a city. The camera moves forward steadily at a measured executive pace. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: deep mahogany, polished steel, charcoal grey, cool city skyline through glass. Loop strategy: camera advances to the head of the table then eases back to the far end, smooth palindrome — dignified and intentional. Motion is deliberate and controlled. Atmosphere: earned authority, structured leadership, high-stakes clarity. Loopable with no jump cuts.
