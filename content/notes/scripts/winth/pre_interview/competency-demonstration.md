=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Clean powerful synth. Precise and ready.]

One breath. Precise. In and out.
Set the standard right now.

A competency demonstration is where you prove — not claim.
Not "I am good at strategic thinking."
You demonstrate strategic thinking in the room.
Not "I have strong communication skills."
You communicate with such precision and clarity that the proof is in the delivery.
The shift from claiming to demonstrating
is the shift from candidate to talent.
Most candidates claim.
You demonstrate.
And that difference is the difference between an offer and a regret.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Synth steady. Precise and forward.]

Here is the competency interview gap.
Employers ask: "Tell me about your analytical ability."
Candidates respond: "I am very analytical. I love data."
That is a claim. An assertion without evidence.
It gives the interviewer nothing to verify.
Nothing to remember. Nothing to check against their rubric.
Compare that to:
"Here is how I think through a problem analytically — let me walk you through one."
And then you do it. Live. In front of them.
You do not describe the competency. You perform it.
That performance is what earns the offer.
Because now the interviewer has seen the thing.
Not been told the thing.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Synth and percussion build with controlled precision.]

Here is your three-step competency demonstration protocol.
Protocol: Map. Perform. Transfer.

Step one is to MAP the competencies they are evaluating.
Before the interview, identify the three to five core competencies for this role.
Read the job description carefully. They are named.
"Strategic thinking." "Stakeholder management." "Data literacy."
For each one, prepare a performance moment.
Not just an example. A micro-demonstration.
For strategic thinking: "Let me walk you through how I would approach this problem."
Then approach a real problem — live, in front of them.
For communication: structure a complex idea in under sixty seconds. Right there.
For leadership: describe a team dynamic and walk through your actual decision framework.
Map the competency. Plan the performance. Have it ready.

Step two is to PERFORM the competency, not describe it.
The performance moment is when you say:
"Instead of telling you about this, let me show you."
Then you show it.
If they ask about your analytical ability, you run a mini-analysis.
"Given what you've told me about the business, here is how I would frame the data problem:
First, I would establish the baseline metric. Second, I would isolate the variables.
Third, I would build a test-and-learn loop around the highest-impact variable."
That mini-analysis took thirty seconds.
But it contains more evidence than a ten-minute description would.
Performance over description. Every time.

Step three is to TRANSFER the demonstrated competency to their specific context.
After the performance, connect it explicitly to their situation.
"That same approach is exactly how I would apply it in your environment
based on what you've described about your current data infrastructure."
The transfer closes the loop.
It says: I am not showing you a general capability.
I am showing you a capability ready to deploy.
For you. Here. Now.

If you are asked to do a task-based demonstration — design sprint, case, presentation —
then bring more than asked.
If they say "bring one slide," bring one polished slide with a verbal brief.
If they say "do a five-minute presentation," bring a crisp close and a confident Q-and-A.
Exceeding the expectation by ten percent is the standard.

If you feel nervous performing live, then remember.
The nervousness is evidence that you care about standard.
That care for standard IS the competency.
Channel it. Let it make you more precise, not less.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Synth softens to a bright, precise melody.]

See yourself in that room performing your competency.
Not describing it. Performing it.
You run the mini-analysis. You structure the idea in sixty seconds.
You walk through your decision framework with clarity.
Hear your voice — precise, crisp, performed with standard.
Feel the confidence of someone who showed up to demonstrate, not just claim.

I am the candidate who demonstrates, not just describes.
I perform my competencies in real time.
I do not claim to be capable. I show that I am.
My standard speaks before I have to argue for it.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Synth resolves to a clean, powerful close.]

Before this interview, identify one competency they are evaluating.
Plan your thirty-second performance moment for that competency.
Practice it once out loud.
That performance is your unfair advantage.

I show the standard I operate at.
I demonstrate, not claim.
The performance is the proof. Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a high-standard, precision-performance instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a bold synth lead over tight percussion — the entrance of a performer who has trained. At forty seconds, additional layers add dimension and competence without clutter. At one minute forty seconds, the full arrangement is executing at peak standard — every element precisely placed. At three minutes ten seconds, a clean final run of the core melody with tight percussion — the competency fully demonstrated. At three fifty-five, a powerful, satisfying resolution. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: demonstrated excellence, real-time performance, earned standard. Style: high-performance cinematic synth. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A forward push through a precision performance space — an empty workshop or studio with clean tools arranged in perfect order, ready for use. The camera advances through the space with the confidence of someone who owns their craft. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: cool steel tools, clean light wood, bright overhead precision light, minimalist craft. Loop strategy: camera advances through the precision workspace to the main work surface, then eases back — palindrome, approach and return. Atmosphere: demonstrated mastery, real-time capability, craft at standard. Loopable with no jump cuts.
