=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Sharp percussion. Alert and precise.]

Breathe. In hard. Out sharp.
One more. In. Out. Go.

Technical interviews are not IQ tests.
Let me say that again. They are NOT IQ tests.
They are process tests.
They want to see HOW you think.
Not whether you can pull a perfect answer from memory.
Whether you can REASON under pressure in real time.
The candidate who freezes and guesses does not get hired.
The candidate who thinks out loud, names their process,
and pushes through uncertainty — that candidate is memorable.
That candidate gets called back.
You are about to be that candidate.
And the thing you need to know is this — you already know how to think.
We just make sure that thinking is AUDIBLE today.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Percussion steady. Urgent and focused.]

Here is the technical interview failure pattern.
The problem is read. There is silence. Five seconds. Ten seconds.
The candidate is thinking but saying nothing.
The interviewer cannot see the thinking.
All they can see is the silence.
And silence in a technical interview reads as stuck.
Even if you are making progress internally — they do not know that.
The second failure is giving up at the first obstacle.
"I'm not sure how to approach this" — and then waiting for rescue.
No rescue is coming. And the person who waits for rescue does not get hired.

Here is the deal. Every technical interviewer is asking ONE meta-question
beneath every problem they give you.
"Does this person know how to work through hard things independently?"
That meta-question is what you answer today.
Not with the perfect answer.
With the audible, organized process of someone who works through hard things.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Percussion builds purposefully. Controlled intensity.]

Here is your three-step technical interview execution protocol.
Protocol: State. Structure. Step.

Step one is to STATE your understanding before you solve anything.
When they give you the problem, pause and repeat back what you heard.
"Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.
We need to find the most efficient way to X, given constraints Y and Z.
Is that right?"
Two things happen when you do this.
You confirm the problem is what you think it is.
And you have just bought yourself thirty seconds to begin thinking.
Both valuable. Always do this. Every single problem.

Step two is to STRUCTURE your approach out loud before you execute.
Before you write code, before you draw the diagram, say the plan.
"I am going to approach this by first handling the edge cases.
Then I will build the base solution.
Then I will optimize if time allows."
That three-part spoken plan does something critical.
The interviewer now knows you have a plan.
Even if your execution is imperfect — and it will be — the plan signals competence.
An imperfect answer with a clear plan beats a perfect answer that appeared from silence.
Because one of those shows thinking. The other shows recall.

Step three is to STEP through the problem verbally as you solve.
"I am using a hash map here because lookup needs to be constant time.
If I used an array, this would be O of N and we might hit performance constraints."
Keep talking. Keep naming. Keep reasoning.
If you get stuck, say: "I am hitting a constraint here. Let me think through it."
Then think through it — out loud.
"One option is X but that creates the problem of Y.
Another option is Z which handles Y but introduces..."
The person who narrates their debugging is more hireable than the person who debugs silently.
Because working in teams requires saying your thinking. Always.

If the problem is too hard and you cannot solve it fully, then say that.
"I cannot get to the complete solution in this time.
Here is what I have built and here is where the gap is."
That is a professional, honest answer.
Pretending toward completion when you are lost is always worse.

If they hint, then RECEIVE the hint explicitly.
"That is a really useful direction. Now I am thinking X."
Receiving coaching well is also a skill they are testing.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Percussion settles to focused groove.]

See yourself in that technical interview right now.
You get the problem. You state your understanding. Confirmed.
You structure your approach. Named.
You step through the solution, talking the whole way.
They are watching you think. They like what they see.
Hear your voice — clear, reasoned, fully present.
Feel the control of someone who made their process visible.

I am the candidate who thinks audibly and reasons precisely.
I do not hide in silence. I make my thinking the answer.
Technical interviews are where my process becomes my proof.
I think out loud. And I own every step.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Percussion drives to a decisive, clean finish.]

Before your technical interview today,
practice stating a problem back out loud.
Then practice saying your plan before you execute.
Those two habits change the interview.

I am prepared to think in public.
My process is the answer. Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a sharp, process-driven instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a tight percussive pattern — alert and ready, like a problem being queued up. At thirty seconds, add a rhythmic synth figure that suggests sequential thinking, one step at a time. At one minute forty seconds, full arrangement in problem-solving mode — deliberate, step-by-step, controlled. At three minutes ten seconds, the percussion and a single synth lead drive to the solution — decisive. At three fifty-five, a clean resolution. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: audible reasoning, process precision, technical ownership. Style: modern technical motivational, step-by-step energy. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow push into a dark coding environment lit by a single focused monitor glow — abstract code-like geometric patterns on the screen, clean and abstract enough to not be readable. The camera advances toward the glow, step by step, as if approaching a problem. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: dark room, monitor blue-green glow, geometric abstract patterns, deep shadow. Loop strategy: camera advances to close proximity to the screen, pauses, then eases back — palindrome, in and returning. Atmosphere: technical process, audible reasoning, problem-ownership. Loopable with no jump cuts.

=== LIBRARY PAIRING OPTIONS ===
Primary Match:
- Visual: Code Monitor Glow Approach — Dark Room Abstract
  - Why: Technical environment with deliberate approach matches urgency_coach think-out-loud protocol
  - Alternative: Abstract Circuit Board Drift — more abstract, same technical energy

- Music: Step-by-Step Synth Drive — Technical Process
  - Why: Sequential percussion and synth mirror State-Structure-Step protocol at 92 BPM
  - Alternative: Precision Hip-Hop Technical — more rhythmic, same process energy

New Custom Prompts:
- Use the Suno and Higgsfield prompts above
- Tailored to technical interview urgency_coach execution protocol
- Both follow all ASMPro format requirements
