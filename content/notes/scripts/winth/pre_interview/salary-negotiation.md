=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Single piano note. Soft breath cue.]

Breathe in slowly for four counts.
Hold. Then release with a long exhale.
Do this once more. Breathe in.
Hold. And let go.

You are stepping into a conversation about value.
Your value. The real kind. The earned kind.
Not the kind you apologize for.
The kind built over years of showing up.

Here is a simple truth worth holding today.
You already know what you bring.
What we do now is make it easy to say.
Because the conversation goes better when you're ready.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues, warm and steady.]

Here is what happens without preparation.
They ask the number. Anxiety spikes fast.
You give a number too low, too quickly.
Or you deflect and say "I'm flexible."
Or you over-explain and talk yourself down.
And money — and respect — stay on the table.

The problem is not that you lack confidence.
The problem is you haven't rehearsed the words.
When the words aren't ready, anxiety fills the space.
And in that space, you settle for less.

Fifty dollars a week, held back over five years,
is thirteen thousand dollars you didn't collect.
The negotiation is worth five minutes of preparation.
You are worth five minutes of preparation.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Warm cello enters beneath the piano.]

Here is your three-step grounding plan.
Plan: Know. Anchor. Hold.

Step one is to know your number with certainty.
Research the market range for this exact role.
Find three real data points from credible sources.
Write a single target number on paper.
Not a range. A specific, real number.
"Ninety-two thousand dollars." Say it clearly.
Specificity signals that you know your worth.
Vague ranges signal that you're guessing.

Step two is to anchor high, with calm reasoning.
Open slightly above your target number.
Not wildly high. Reasonably, confidently high.
Then support it with three brief accomplishments.
Each one should have a measurable outcome.
"I reduced onboarding time by thirty percent."
"I grew the team from four to eleven people."
"I closed two hundred thousand in new accounts last year."
The data does the convincing. You stay calm.

Step three is to hold the pause after speaking.
Say your number. Then say nothing.
The silence is not awkward. It is professional.
It signals comfort. It signals you are not negotiating against yourself.
Whoever fills the silence first, concedes first.
Let them fill it.

If they push back on the number, then breathe first.
Then say: "I understand. Here is why the number holds."
Restate one accomplishment. One. Not a speech.
One clear, specific win. Then wait again.

If they ask your current salary, then redirect calmly.
Say: "I'm focused on the value I bring to this role.
The market rate for this scope is X."
Practice that sentence out loud before you walk in.

If doubt surfaces before you speak, then read your three wins.
One slow read of three real accomplishments.
That is all you need to remember who you are.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens to solo piano, intimate.]

See yourself sitting across from them now.
Your posture is easy. Your hands are still.
They ask for your number. You breathe first.
Then you say the number. Clear. Measured. Without apology.
Hear your own voice — steady and precise.
Feel the quiet confidence of having prepared well.
You are not performing. You are presenting what is true.

I am the person who knows my market value.
I am prepared. I am clear. I do not shrink.
I negotiate from evidence, not from fear.
I hold my number because I know what it represents.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Single piano note holds and fades.]

Before you walk into that room today,
write down your target number right now.
Write three accomplishments — each with a real result.
Read them once. Set the paper aside.
You are ready.

I am the professional who knows my worth.
This conversation today is just confirmation.
Go show them what you already know.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a calm, contemplative instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Begin with a single piano melody — warm, minimal, with generous silence between phrases. At thirty seconds, introduce soft cello underneath for added warmth. At one minute forty seconds, let both instruments deepen slightly — like sitting in a quiet office before an important meeting. At three minutes ten seconds, pull back to piano alone, intimate and reflective. At three fifty-five, fade gently to a single held note and silence. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: dignified, self-assured, grounded. Style: acoustic chamber music, minimalist. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow aerial drift over a gleaming city at dawn, office towers catching the first light. The camera glides forward at a barely perceptible pace — almost still but always moving. The center frame is clean and uncluttered, reserved for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: warm gold, cool blue, silver morning light. Loop strategy: camera reaches its forward drift point and eases back to start in a palindrome loop, seamless. Motion is meditative, not urgent. Atmosphere: early morning clarity, professional confidence, earned readiness. Loopable with no jump cuts.
