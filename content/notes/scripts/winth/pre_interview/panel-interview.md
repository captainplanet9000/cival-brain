=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Sharp percussion. Immediate energy.]

Take a breath RIGHT NOW.
Deep. All the way down.
Hold it. Now release.

You are about to walk into a room with multiple people
all looking at you at the same time.
Multiple sets of eyes. Multiple agendas. Multiple perspectives.
And I am telling you — that is not a threat.
That is an opportunity.
Every person in that room has a different need.
And you get to meet ALL of them.
ONE candidate. Multiple audiences. One shot.
You are ready for this. Let me show you how.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Percussion steady. Driven and focused.]

Here is where panel interviews fall apart.
Candidates lock eye contact with one person — usually the boss —
and forget the other three people in the room.
Those three people have VOTES.
They have influence. They will walk out of that room
and give their opinion. You ignored them. You lose.

Or a candidate gets flustered by the rapid-fire format.
One person asks a question. The next one jumps in.
The pace accelerates. The candidate loses the thread.
They start talking faster and saying less.
Do not be that candidate today.
You are not scattered. You are a conductor.
And every panel is an orchestra waiting for your direction.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Percussion builds purposefully. Energy focused.]

Here is your three-step panel interview protocol.
Protocol: Map. Sweep. Close.

Step one is to MAP the panel before you answer anything.
When introductions happen, note each person's role.
Quickly and mentally: who is the hiring manager,
who is the peer, who is the cross-functional stakeholder.
The hiring manager evaluates fit for the role.
The peer evaluates "can I work with this person."
The stakeholder evaluates impact on their team.
Now you know what each person needs to hear.
One answer. Three different parts of that answer aimed strategically.

Step two is to SWEEP with your eye contact.
When you answer a question, start with the person who asked.
But as your answer develops, sweep the room.
Spend two to three seconds per person.
Return to the questioner at the close of your answer.
That sweep says: I acknowledge you ALL.
No one feels invisible. Everyone feels addressed.
That is the difference between a candidate and a communicator.

Step three is to CLOSE the panel with direct engagement.
Before you leave, ask a direct question to each person.
Not a general question to the group.
"Alex, from your role leading operations,
what is the biggest challenge you'd want me to address first?"
Now Alex feels seen. Alex feels consulted. Alex wants you hired.
Do this for every panel member if time allows.
If not, do it for at least two. The ones with the most doubt.

If multiple people talk over each other, then pause and redirect.
Say: "I want to make sure I address both points clearly.
Let me take them in order." Take control. With calm.

If a question catches you completely off guard, then buy a second.
Say: "That is a sharp question. Let me think about that."
A five-second pause is not weakness. It is precision.

If you feel the energy in the room dip, then raise yours slightly.
Not panic energy. Engaged, leaning-in energy.
A story usually re-engages a drifting panel.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Percussion softens to a tight, focused groove.]

See yourself seated in that panel room right now.
Five people. All eyes on you.
You are not rattled. You are PRESENT.
You answer a question and you sweep the room with your eyes.
Every person nods. Every person feels seen.
Hear your voice — clear, confident, commanding the space.
Feel the control of a person who came prepared for exactly this.

I am the candidate who shows up for the whole room.
I am clear. I am adaptable. I am in command.
Panel interviews are where I prove I can lead from any chair.
I own every seat at that table — including mine.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Percussion drives to a clean finish.]

Before you walk in, write down the names and roles of the panel.
Map them. Know what each person needs to hear.
Remember — sweep the room. Close with direct questions.

I am ready for multiple perspectives.
I perform at my best when the stakes are highest.
That room is mine. Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a high-energy, purposeful instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open immediately with a tight percussion pattern and a driving synth bass — no slow intro, energy from bar one. At forty-five seconds, add a bold melodic synth line that builds urgency with precision and control. At one minute forty seconds, the full arrangement hits — percussion, bass, melody all working together with intensity. At three minutes, strip back to percussion and bass only — focused and tactical. At three fifty-five, a final decisive hit fades quickly. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: controlled intensity, tactical urgency, peak readiness. Style: hip-hop influenced motivational, driving. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, purposeful advance down a long conference table viewed from one end — the table stretches forward, chairs empty, overhead lights casting clean parallel shadows. The camera advances at a deliberate pace down the center of the table's length. The center of the frame is uncluttered for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: deep charcoal, polished wood, cool overhead light, slate blue. Loop strategy: camera advances down the table length to the far end, then seamlessly cuts back to the head — forward motion only, looped. Atmosphere: multiple perspectives converging, command presence, high-stakes readiness. Loopable with no jump cuts.
