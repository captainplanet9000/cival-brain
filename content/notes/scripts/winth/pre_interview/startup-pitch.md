=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Low piano. Measured and deliberate.]

Breathe. In through the nose. Hold.
Out slowly. Again.

Before you pitch, understand what you are really doing.
You are not selling a product.
You are selling a vision and demonstrating judgment.
The investors or evaluators in that room are asking one thing:
"Do I believe in this person's ability to execute?"
The deck is secondary. Your conviction is primary.
The pitch is not a presentation.
It is a demonstration of how you think under pressure.
And you think clearly under pressure.
We prepare that demonstration right now.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano steady. Structured authority.]

Here is where startup pitches collapse.
The founder knows the product deeply.
So deeply that the pitch becomes a product tour.
Feature by feature. Use case by use case.
And somewhere around slide four,
the investors stop asking "should I invest"
and start asking "when does this end."

The pitch fails because it serves the founder's knowledge,
not the investor's decision.
Investors do not need to understand your product fully.
They need to see three things:
The problem is real. Your solution is credible. You can execute.
That is the entire pitch. Everything else is supporting evidence.
Know the three things. Lead with them. Never lose them.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Strings enter. Precise and authoritative.]

Here is your three-step pitch command framework.
Framework: Problem. Credibility. Momentum.

Step one is to open with the PROBLEM in visceral terms.
Not market size statistics in the first sixty seconds.
A real, felt problem. One sentence that makes them feel it.
"Right now, forty percent of small business owners
miss their highest-growth season because they can't hire fast enough.
We built the solution for that."
They feel the problem. They believe it exists. You have them.

Step two is to demonstrate CREDIBILITY through evidence.
Not credentials. Evidence of traction.
"We have twelve paying customers. We have forty-three thousand in revenue.
Our retention rate is ninety-two percent after six months."
Or: "We have conducted eighty interviews. Every single one confirmed the same pain.
Three enterprise clients are in letter-of-intent conversation now."
Credibility is proof that reality is already moving in your direction.
No traction yet? Show depth of research. Show pilot results.
Show that you know this problem better than anyone else in the room.

Step three is to close with MOMENTUM and a clear ask.
What has happened. What you need. What happens next.
"We are raising a seed round of five hundred thousand.
That capital funds us to first revenue milestone in nine months.
I am asking for a commitment conversation by end of month."
Specific. Forward. Decisive. Executives make commitments. Make the ask.

If they ask a question you cannot fully answer, then anchor on what you know.
"I don't have the exact number in front of me.
What I can tell you is the directional reality is X."
Honesty under pressure builds more trust than a wrong number.

If skepticism enters the room, then invite it.
"That is a fair concern. Here is how I think about the risk."
You are not defending. You are showing your thinking.

If the energy in the room is flat, then find one person who is leaning in.
Pitch to their energy for thirty seconds. Let it spread.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens to controlled, clear piano.]

See yourself standing in that pitch room.
The deck is minimal. Your conviction fills the space.
You open with the problem and the room shifts.
They are listening. Genuinely listening.
Hear your voice — clear, controlled, visionary.
Feel the certainty of someone who believes in what they've built.

I am the founder who pitches with clarity and conviction.
I lead with the problem. I prove credibility with evidence.
I make the ask without apology.
The pitch is not what I do. It is who I am.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano resolves. Single clear note. Fades.]

Write your one-sentence problem statement right now.
Then write three evidence points proving credibility.
Practice your opening ninety seconds standing up.
That is the pitch. Everything else supports it.

I walk in with clarity of vision and precision of execution.
The room believes in me because I believe in what I've built.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a visionary, authoritative instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Begin with a low piano and building string figure — like the moment before a significant idea is revealed. At forty seconds, strings and piano build together with controlled intensity — purposeful, not triumphant yet. At one minute forty seconds, reach a structured peak — the moment conviction meets evidence, orchestral and precise. At three minutes, pull back to piano and sparse strings — clear-eyed and resolved. At three fifty-five, close with a forward-looking final phrase. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: visionary conviction, executive precision, earned belief. Style: modern orchestral, pitch-room gravity. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow upward drift through the glass ceiling of a modern startup workspace or innovation center — light spilling down from a skylight, clean architectural geometry above. The camera tilts slowly upward toward the light, deliberate and visionary. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: white, steel, warm amber skylight, cool architectural grey. Loop strategy: camera drifts up toward the light then gently eases back to start level in a palindrome — reaching then returning, visionary and grounded. Atmosphere: possibility, conviction, earned ambition. Loopable with no jump cuts.
