=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft piano and light strings. Gently opening.]

Find a comfortable position right now.
Breathe in slowly. Hold for just a moment.
Now let it all go with a long exhale.

You are preparing to show leadership today.
Not perform leadership. Show it.
There is an important difference.
Performing leadership is exhausting.
It requires pretending to be something you are not.
Showing leadership is natural.
It is letting what is already inside you come forward.
You have led before. You lead every day.
Today is about letting that be visible.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Strings and piano continue, warm and even.]

Here is the thing about leadership presence in interviews.
Most candidates describe leadership from a distance.
They say things like "I manage a team" or "I delegate well."
But those words don't create presence. They just list tasks.
Leadership presence is felt, not recited.
It is in the way you pause before answering.
It is in the calm certainty you carry into the room.
It is in how you make the interviewer feel heard.

And the challenge is this.
When we are nervous, presence disappears first.
We speed up, look down, and over-explain.
The very thing we are trying to show
gets obscured by the anxiety of trying to show it.
That is what we solve today.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters, warm and spacious.]

Here is your three-step leadership presence plan.
Plan: Slow. Anchor. Reflect.

Step one is to slow everything down by ten percent.
Leadership presence lives in the unhurried moment.
When you are asked a question, take one breath first.
That breath is not a delay. It is presence.
It signals: this person does not react. They respond.
Lower your pace slightly when you begin to answer.
Let your words arrive with weight. Leaders speak with weight.

Step two is to anchor your language in real moments.
Do not describe leadership in general terms.
Find a specific moment when you led through difficulty.
A moment of conflict you navigated well.
A team that doubted the path and you held steady.
A decision you made with incomplete information.
That moment is your evidence. Tell it without embellishment.
"My team was six weeks behind on a critical launch.
I held a thirty-minute reset meeting. I redistributed scope.
We launched ten days late — but we launched together."
Specific moments create presence. Abstractions create distance.

Step three is to reflect leadership in how you listen.
Ask a thoughtful question about the team you'd be leading.
"What is the greatest challenge the team is navigating right now?"
Then listen fully. Do not prepare your next answer while they talk.
Look at them. Nod. Say something that shows you heard.
That quality — full presence while listening —
is the most visible and rare leadership skill in any room.

If you feel like you don't have "big" enough stories, then reframe.
Leadership is scale-independent.
A leader of two people who doubled performance is exceptional.
Your evidence does not need to be large. It needs to be real.

If nerves cause you to rush, then remember: pause is powerful.
If you begin to compare yourself to others in the room, then stop.
You are not competing with their journey. You are presenting yours.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens. Only gentle strings.]

See yourself in that interview room right now.
You are unhurried. Your eyes are steady and warm.
You speak slowly and clearly. The interviewer leans in.
They are not just hearing your words. They are feeling your presence.
Hear your own voice — measured, grounded, real.
Feel the ease of someone who is simply being who they are.

I am the leader who shows up fully present.
I am the person who listens before I lead.
I am calm in uncertainty and clear in complexity.
I do not perform leadership. I live it.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Strings fade slowly to silence.]

Right now, think of one specific leadership moment.
Write two sentences about it. Real details. Real outcome.
That is your anchor story for today.

I am a leader. Not because of a title.
Because of how I show up.
Today I show up fully.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a warm, spacious instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with soft piano and light string pad — gentle and inviting. The melody should feel like reassurance, not urgency. At fifty seconds, a subtle cello enters, grounding the piece with warmth. At one minute forty seconds, let all instruments develop in slow, unhurried phrases — evoking quiet confidence and inner leadership. At three minutes ten seconds, soften to strings alone, reflective and still. At three fifty-five, let the strings breathe to silence. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: gentle strength, emotional steadiness, earned authority. Style: cinematic chamber, gentle. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow upward drift through soft, diffused natural light — like looking up through tree canopy or frosted glass, light filtering in from above. The camera tilts very slowly upward, steady and unhurried. The center frame is clean and uncluttered for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: soft green, ivory, warm light, gentle gold. Loop strategy: camera drifts upward to full brightness, then gently eases back down — palindrome loop, seamless. Motion is breath-like. Atmosphere: quiet strength, natural authority, inner calm. Loopable with no jump cuts.
