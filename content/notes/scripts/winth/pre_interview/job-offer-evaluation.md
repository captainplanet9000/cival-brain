=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft piano and warm guitar. Easy and open.]

Take a slow breath in. Hold gently.
Now release. Long and full.
Once more. In.
And out.

A job offer has arrived. That is a real accomplishment.
Someone looked at everything you offered
and decided: we want this person.
Let that land for a moment.
Before the analysis. Before the comparison.
Just let the recognition arrive first.
You earned this offer.
And now the decision in front of you is significant.
Not urgent — significant.
The quality of this decision will shape years of your life.
So today, we think about it clearly, honestly, and with wisdom.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Music continues, warm and thoughtful.]

Here is the job offer pressure trap.
The offer arrives and immediately the pressure comes with it.
"We need an answer by Friday."
"Everyone says to just take it if it's a good company."
"What if I say no and nothing better comes?"
The pressure collapses the thoughtfulness you need.
And decisions made under that pressure
are often the ones you quietly revisit later.
A year in, wondering why you said yes so fast.

The truth is: an offer always deserves careful evaluation.
Not because you are being difficult.
Not because you want to play games.
Because a job is not just a paycheck.
It is where you spend a significant portion of your waking life.
It deserves the quality of attention you would give
any other major life decision.
Today you give it that attention.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello joins, warm and supportive.]

Here is your three-step job offer evaluation framework.
Framework: Values. Terms. Fit.

Step one is to evaluate the offer against your VALUES.
Before you look at the salary or the benefits,
ask yourself one foundational question.
"Does the work itself align with what I care about building?"
Not "is it a good company." Not "is it impressive."
Does the work matter to you?
Write down your top three professional values.
They might be autonomy, growth, impact, stability, collaboration.
Then rate the offer against each one.
If the offer hits two of your three values strongly, that is significant.
If it hits none of them — the number is just a number.

Step two is to evaluate the TERMS with full specificity.
Not just the base salary. Everything.
Growth trajectory — where does this role lead in two years?
Manager quality — what do you know or what can you learn about your direct manager?
Benefits that actually matter to you — flexibility, healthcare, retirement, equity.
Culture signals — how did the people in the process treat you?
Were they kind when there was nothing to gain from it?
Make a full list. Know what you are actually agreeing to.

Step three is to EVALUATE FIT by checking your gut.
After you have done the analysis, sit with the decision quietly.
Not rumination. A genuine check-in.
"If I accept this offer and start Monday — does that feel right or forced?"
Your nervous system knows things your analysis misses.
If excitement is present — even with uncertainty — that is a signal.
If dread is present — even with a good number — that too is a signal.
Both deserve attention.

If you want to negotiate before deciding, then this is the moment.
You do not have to choose between accepting and declining.
You can ask for more. For different terms. For more time.
"I am very interested. I would like to discuss the base compensation
and have two additional days to make my final decision."
That is a professional, reasonable request. Make it.

If the offer feels wrong but you feel guilty saying no,
then remember: saying no to this is saying yes to something better aligned.
You are not rejecting a person. You are honoring your direction.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens. Guitar alone, gentle and honest.]

Picture yourself holding this offer in your hands.
You have done the values check. You have reviewed the terms.
You have listened to your gut.
You know your answer. And you know it is yours.
Hear your voice as you respond — calm, certain, appreciative.
Feel the clarity of a decision made with wisdom, not just relief.

I am the professional who makes decisions from clarity, not pressure.
I evaluate offers wisely. I know what I value.
My decision is informed, honest, and fully mine.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Music fades gently to quiet.]

Write your three professional values right now.
Then rate this offer against each one.
Trust the score. Trust the gut check.

I make wise decisions. I honor my direction.
This offer deserves a thoughtful answer. I give it one.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a thoughtful, gentle instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with soft piano and warm acoustic guitar together — a conversation between two voices, like two perspectives of the same decision. At forty-five seconds, the melody develops with careful, unhurried beauty — not urgency, wisdom. At one minute forty seconds, a cello enters below with grounding emotional depth. At three minutes ten seconds, guitar and piano soften together — the decision becoming clearer. At three fifty-five, a final warm resolving phrase to quiet. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: wise evaluation, gentle clarity, thoughtful self-knowledge. Style: acoustic chamber, contemplative. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, contemplative close-up drift across an open notebook with a pen resting on it — blank pages, morning light, a cup nearby. The camera drifts slowly as if in thoughtful consideration, moving gently across the open pages. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: warm cream, golden morning light, dark ink pen, muted background. Loop strategy: camera drifts across the notebook from left to right, then eases back in a gentle palindrome — back and forth, deliberate and unhurried. Atmosphere: wise consideration, self-honest evaluation, thoughtful clarity. Loopable with no jump cuts.
