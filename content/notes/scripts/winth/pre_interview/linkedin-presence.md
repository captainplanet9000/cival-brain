=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Clean synth. Bright and purposeful.]

One breath. In and out.
Set your standard. Now.

Your LinkedIn profile is not a digital resume.
It is a first impression that happens before you enter any room.
Recruiters, hiring managers, potential clients, future collaborators —
all of them look at your profile before they decide whether to engage.
And here is the standard most people operate at:
Outdated job descriptions. No headline worth reading.
A summary that sounds like everyone else's.
Photo from three years ago.
That standard produces invisible.
Invisible people do not get the opportunities they deserve.
You are operating at a different standard today.
Your profile is an opening statement.
And opening statements are either compelling or they cost you.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Synth steady. Crisp and driving.]

Here is the LinkedIn presence gap that most professionals carry.
They treat their profile as a record of the past.
Education. Previous jobs. Skills added arbitrarily.
But the profile that gets people to say yes
is not a record of the past.
It is a demonstration of the present.
What you do. What you solve. What you uniquely bring.
Written in the language of the person who needs to hire you.
Not in the language of the job titles you have held.

The current standard produces profiles that are technically complete
and completely forgettable.
If your profile does not answer — in eight seconds —
"why should I reach out to this person,"
you are not being seen. You are being skipped.
The gap between seen and skipped is a few hours of strategic effort.
We close that gap right now.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Synth and percussion build with precision and clarity.]

Here is your three-step LinkedIn optimization protocol.
Protocol: Headline. Summary. Evidence.

Step one is to REWRITE your headline to communicate value, not title.
Your current title tells people what your job is called.
Your headline should tell people what you solve.
"Software Engineer at Company X" — that is a title.
"Software Engineer | I build systems that scale past ten million users" — that is a hook.
"Senior HR Manager | I build cultures where retention is a competitive advantage."
"Financial Analyst | I turn complex data into decisions that move capital."
Each of those headlines answers one question: why should I care?
Rewrite your headline to answer that question.
Today. Before anything else.

Step two is to REWRITE your summary as a value narrative.
Your summary should do three things.
One — establish who you are in one vivid sentence.
Two — describe the specific problems you are built to solve.
Three — signal what kind of collaboration you are open to.
Avoid: a list of adjectives. Avoid: "results-driven professional."
Avoid: jargon that looks impressive and means nothing.
Aim for: clarity. Aim for: specificity. Aim for: one sentence per idea.
Read your summary out loud. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it.
If it sounds like a real person with a real skill set, you are close.

Step three is to anchor your EVIDENCE in specific, measurable results.
In every job listing, add at minimum one accomplishment with a number.
Not "responsible for client relationships."
"Managed a portfolio of forty-two enterprise clients with ninety-four percent retention."
Not "led team projects." "Led a cross-functional team of eight through a six-month platform migration."
Numbers make claims real. Real claims get responses.
Go back through every listed role and find the number.

If your profile has a weak or missing photo, then fix that first.
Profiles with photos receive twenty-one times more views.
Professional quality. Neutral background. Clear face. Current.
That is the standard. Set it.

If you have a skills section with forty skills listed, then audit it.
Keep the top ten most relevant to the work you want to do next.
Recruiters filter by skills. The right ten matter more than forty random ones.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Synth softens to a clear, precise melody.]

See your profile as it will look when it is at standard.
Your headline is specific and worth a second look.
Your summary is clear, real, and distinct.
Your experience section anchors every role in real outcomes.
Hear the impact of someone reading it and saying — I need to reach out.
Feel the precision of a professional presence that reflects your actual value.

I am the professional whose profile speaks with precision and clarity.
My headline hooks. My summary engages. My evidence proves.
My LinkedIn presence opens doors because I built it to.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Synth resolves to a clean, decisive finish.]

Right now, open your LinkedIn profile.
Rewrite your headline in the next ten minutes.
Value communicated, not title recited.
That is the first improvement. Then the summary. Then the evidence.

I operate at a standard that gets me seen.
My profile is my opening statement.
And it is compelling.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a precise, forward-focused instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a clean synth lead over tight precision percussion — bright and immediate. At forty seconds, a bass synth layer gives the track crisp depth. At one minute forty seconds, the arrangement builds to clear, structured energy — like a professional profile coming into full focus. At three minutes ten seconds, strip to a bright lead synth and clean rhythm — the final sharpening. At three fifty-five, a decisive, satisfying close. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: precision optimization, digital visibility, professional elevation. Style: modern electronic motivational, clean and forward. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow push toward a glowing computer screen displaying abstract blue-white geometric light — minimal, clean, high-contrast. The camera advances toward the screen as if approaching a professional interface. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: electric blue, clean white, deep navy background, crisp screen light. Loop strategy: camera advances toward the glowing screen, then eases back — palindrome, approach and return. Atmosphere: digital presence, professional clarity, visible optimization. Loopable with no jump cuts.
