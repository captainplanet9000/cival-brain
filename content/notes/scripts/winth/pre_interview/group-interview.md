=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Sharp percussion. Immediate and focused.]

Breathe. Deep. In and out.
Wake up. You are in a room with other candidates.

Let me tell you something right now.
A group interview is not a competition to talk the most.
It is not who can be the LOUDEST or the most aggressive.
The people who stand out in group interviews
are NOT the ones who dominate the conversation.
They are the ones who show two things simultaneously:
Leadership AND collaboration.
Assertiveness AND awareness.
That is a more sophisticated skill than just being loud.
And you are going to demonstrate that skill today.
Let's get you ready.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Percussion steady. Focused energy.]

Here is the group interview mistake most candidates make.
They walk in trying to be noticed at all costs.
They interrupt. They talk over. They one-up.
And the hiring team watches all of this and thinks:
"If this person dominates a group of four candidates,
what do they do in a meeting with our clients?"
The aggressive candidate almost never gets hired.
Because companies do not need lone rangers.
They need people who can lead AND collaborate.
They need people who make others around them better.
The group interview is your chance to show THAT person.
Not the person who talks loudest.
The person who creates more signal than noise.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Percussion builds. Purposeful and calibrated.]

Here is your three-step group interview command protocol.
Protocol: Contribute. Elevate. Close.

Step one is to CONTRIBUTE early and specifically.
Within the first five minutes, say something of substance.
Not just a comment. A contribution.
Ask a clarifying question that frames the task better.
Add a specific observation that sharpens the group's direction.
"Before we dive into solutions, I want to make sure I understand the constraint.
Is the primary concern speed, or long-term scalability?"
That one question does three things at once.
It shows strategic thinking. It improves the group's outcome.
And it demonstrates leadership without requiring anyone to follow you.
Make your first contribution one that helps everyone in the room.
That is how you get noticed. Not by making others invisible.

Step two is to ELEVATE other candidates' ideas.
This is counterintuitive and powerful.
When someone in the group says something genuinely useful, name it.
"What Sarah just raised about X is exactly the right framing.
I want to build on that."
You are not diminishing yourself by crediting someone else.
You are demonstrating that you are the kind of person
who builds teams up rather than competing them down.
Hiring managers notice this. Every single time.
The candidate who elevates others stands out more than the one who competes.

Step three is to CLOSE the group exercise with a strong summary or synthesis.
At the end of any group task, there is usually a gap.
The gap between "we discussed a lot of things" and "here is our recommendation."
Fill that gap.
"What I am hearing from our discussion is three key points.
First X. Second Y. Third Z.
My recommendation, based on what we've built together, is this."
That synthesis move is a visible leadership act.
It shows that you can listen, organize, and deliver.
In thirty seconds, you demonstrate three critical competencies.

If another candidate is dominating unfairly, then redirect diplomatically.
"I want to make sure we are hearing from everyone before we finalize.
[Name], what is your take on this?"
You are not attacking. You are creating space. That is leadership.

If you feel you are not speaking enough, then pick a natural break.
Say: "I want to add one specific point here."
Then add it. Clean. Brief. Move on.

If the group is going in the wrong direction, then course-correct early.
"I want to raise one concern before we go further —
I think we may be optimizing for the wrong variable."
Then offer the alternative. Gently but clearly.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Percussion softens to a focused, controlled groove.]

See yourself in that group right now.
Five candidates. You contribute early and specifically.
You credit someone's idea and build on it.
At the end, you synthesize clearly and decisively.
Hear your voice — measured, collaborative, distinctly present.
Feel the quiet confidence of someone who leads without dominating.

I am the candidate who makes the group around me better.
I contribute. I elevate. I synthesize.
I stand out without standing over.
Group interviews are where my leadership shows up most clearly.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Percussion drives to a clean, decisive finish.]

Before the session today, write one clarifying question.
One that improves the group's work.
Have it ready. Use it in the first five minutes.

I am the leader who makes teams better.
I am the candidate who stands out the right way.
Let's show them.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a driven, collaborative instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with tight percussion and a melodic synth line — purposeful and group-dynamic. At forty seconds, a secondary synth voice enters alongside the first — two voices in tension that eventually resolve cooperatively. At one minute forty seconds, both voices plus percussion are performing together — a demonstration of individual contribution within a group. At three minutes ten seconds, a clear synthesized resolution — the group's final answer. At three fifty-five, a clean powerful close. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: collaborative leadership, group dynamic, individual signal. Style: modern motivational with dual synth voices. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A push down a clean, modern assessment center corridor into a bright, open group room — white boards visible at the edges, clean tables arranged for collaboration. The camera advances purposefully but not aggressively, as if entering a space meant for cooperative work. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: bright white, clean blue-grey surfaces, open natural light, modern minimalism. Loop strategy: camera advances into the room to a mid-point, then eases back — palindrome, in and returning. Atmosphere: group leadership, collaborative contribution, dynamic presence. Loopable with no jump cuts.
