=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Low piano. Measured and thoughtful.]

Breathe in. Four counts. Hold. Release.
Again. Deliberate. Measured.

You have secured time with someone whose perspective holds value.
That is not accidental. You made it happen.
And the quality of this conversation is entirely in your hands.
Mentorship is not passive.
It is not "what do you think I should do with my career?"
That question shifts the work to the mentor.
Your mentor's time is limited and precise.
The quality of your preparation determines the quality of what you receive.
Walk into this meeting with precision.
Come with questions. Come with context. Come with a specific ask.
The more prepared you are, the more useful they can be.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues. Structured and warm.]

Here is why most mentor meetings fall short of their potential.
The mentee arrives without a clear agenda.
They are hoping for wisdom to arrive organically.
But wisdom without context is generic.
And generic advice, however well-intentioned,
rarely changes the specific thing you need changed.
A mentor who does not know your exact situation
cannot give you exact guidance.
They give you principles. General perspectives.
Which are valuable — but rarely transformative.

The mentee who transforms from these meetings
is the one who says: "Here is my specific situation.
Here is what I have already tried.
Here is the specific question I need help with."
That mentee walks out with precise, actionable insight.
That is the mentee you are today.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Strings enter under piano. Warm, structured.]

Here is your three-step mentor meeting command framework.
Framework: Prepare. Extract. Commit.

Step one is to PREPARE three specific questions before the meeting.
Not three topics. Three specific, shaped questions.
The difference matters.
A topic is "career direction." A question is:
"I am deciding between path A and path B.
Given what you know about the market and my background,
which direction do you think gives me more leverage in five years?"
That question gives your mentor something real to work with.
Write your three questions before the meeting.
Rank them. Ask the most important one first.
If time runs short, you got the most important answer.

Step two is to EXTRACT insight by sharing context first.
Before you ask each question, give your mentor the relevant context.
"In my current role, I've been doing X for two years.
The next step I'm considering is Y.
The concern I have is Z."
Then ask the question.
The context is not padding. It is the foundation for useful insight.
Without it, your mentor is guessing.
With it, they are advising.

Step three is to COMMIT to one action from the conversation.
Before the meeting ends, summarize what you heard.
"What I'm taking from this conversation is that I should prioritize X.
I am going to do that by [specific date]."
Then ask: "Does that capture what you were recommending?"
That close does three things.
It confirms you heard correctly.
It demonstrates that you intend to act.
And it respects the mentor's time by completing the loop.
Follow up after you act. That is what earns the next meeting.

If the conversation goes in an unexpected direction, then follow it.
Some of the most valuable insight is not what you planned to receive.
But if you drift too far, bring it back:
"I want to make sure I get to my key question.
I have about ten minutes left — may I go there now?"

If you disagree with the mentor's perspective, then thank them first.
"That's a perspective I hadn't fully considered.
I want to sit with that before I respond."
Disagreement in mentorship is often where the most growth lives.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens. Piano and cello, clear and settled.]

See yourself in that meeting room or call now.
Your three questions are prepared. Your context is ready.
You open with your most important question. Clear and specific.
Your mentor engages. They lean in. They give real guidance.
Hear your voice — organized, curious, appropriately direct.
Feel the clarity of someone who made the most of limited time.

I am the mentee who honors my mentor's time with preparation.
I ask precise questions. I share real context.
I leave with actionable insight and a committed next step.
This meeting changes something real. Because I came ready.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano resolves to a single deliberate note.]

Right now, write your three questions for this meeting.
Rank them. The first question is the most important one.
Give your mentor context before each question.
Leave with one committed action.

I use the time wisely.
Because time with the right person changes the trajectory.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a measured, elegant instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Begin with a deliberate piano — thoughtful, executive in register, like someone preparing to speak carefully. At forty seconds, a controlled string line enters — professional warmth, not sentiment. At one minute forty seconds, both develop with structured clarity — like a guided conversation reaching its most useful point. At three minutes ten seconds, reduce to piano alone — settled and resolved. At three fifty-five, a single dignified closing phrase. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: executive preparation, respectful precision, earned mentorship. Style: modern chamber, professional consultation register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, measured push across a clean desk in a well-appointed private office — organized notes, a glass of water, soft directional lamp light. The camera moves slowly left to right across the consultation space. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: warm lamp light, deep wood, clean ivory paper, polished surface. Loop strategy: camera drifts across the desk space to the right edge, then eases back in a palindrome — measured and unhurried, like a consultation unfolding. Atmosphere: executive mentorship, valuable time, organized preparation. Loopable with no jump cuts.
