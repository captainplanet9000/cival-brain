=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Low piano chord. Measured and deliberate.]

Breathe in. Four counts. Hold. Release.
Again. In. Hold. Out.

You are about to enter a room where impressions form fast.
In the first seven seconds, they decide if you belong.
Not your credentials. Not your answers. You.
The way you move. The way you hold the room.
The way you choose to begin.

This is not performance. It is preparation.
Executive presence is not arrogance.
It is the quiet signal that you belong at the table.
We prepare that signal right now.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano steady. Low strings underneath.]

Here is where executive presence breaks down.
Most candidates know their content cold.
But they rush through the door, hand out quickly,
eyes scanning the room for approval.
That scan — that tiny search for permission —
is where presence disappears.

You cannot project authority while seeking it at the same time.
The question your body asks before your mouth opens
is the first thing they hear.
"Do I belong here?" signals doubt.
"I am here to solve a problem" signals gravity.

The room reads you before you speak.
Let the room read the right message.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Piano and strings develop, structured and authoritative.]

Here is your three-step executive presence protocol.
Protocol: Enter. Occupy. Command.

Step one is to enter with full physical intention.
Before you walk through the door, pause outside.
Straighten. Breathe. Set your jaw slightly.
Walk in at seventy percent speed. Not slow. Measured.
Make deliberate eye contact with the first person you see.
Smile once — brief, genuine, controlled.
Extend your hand and give your name clearly.
"Good morning. [Your name]."
Three words. Not an apology. Not a performance. An arrival.

Step two is to occupy your space fully.
Sit back slightly in the chair. Not slouched. Grounded.
Do not lean forward in anticipation of their approval.
Let them come to you. Ask the first question? You are ready.
When you answer, speak to a point above the question.
"The core challenge I'd address in this role is X."
Lead the frame. Don't follow it.
Executive presence means you bring the agenda, not just answers.

Step three is to close with forward momentum.
As the interview ends, do not drift out.
Have one prepared closing statement ready.
"I want to say clearly — this role aligns with the trajectory
I've been building for the past four years.
I have strong conviction here and I'd welcome next steps."
That sentence is decisive. Decisive people get callbacks.

If they make you wait before entering, then use the time.
Stand or sit with deliberate posture. Breathe slowly.
Do not check your phone. Executive presence doesn't idle.

If the room feels skeptical or cold, then hold your tempo.
Do not raise your energy to match their doubt.
Let your steadiness be the temperature of the room.

If you feel the urge to over-explain, then stop at the close.
Say the point. State the evidence. Stop.
Executives are economical. Be economical.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music structures to a singular, clear phrase.]

See yourself entering that room right now.
You move with intention. You stand tall. You take up space.
They offer you a seat. You sit back. You are grounded.
They ask the first question. You pause. Then you lead.
Hear your voice — low, measured, certain.
Feel the quiet authority of someone who has earned the right to be here.

I am the professional who commands the rooms I enter.
I do not seek permission. I bring contribution.
I am calm, structured, and clear.
Executive presence is not what I perform — it is who I am.

[3:55-4:30] ATTENTION
[Piano resolves to a single low chord. Fades.]

Before you walk in today, pause at the door.
Set your posture. Set your breath. Set your intent.
"I am here to solve a problem. I belong at this table."

I walk in ready. I perform with precision.
The room responds to who I already am.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose an authoritative, structured instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Begin with a low piano chord — deliberate, grounded, measured. At thirty seconds, introduce a string section with controlled precision, not swelling emotion. At one minute forty seconds, the composition builds to a structured midpoint — piano and strings moving together with purpose and economy, like a boardroom entering focus. At three minutes ten seconds, strip back to piano alone — firm and clear. At three fifty-five, resolve to a single final low chord that holds and fades. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: authoritative, measured, professional gravitas. Style: modern executive, structured. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, precise push forward through a high-ceiling modern lobby or hallway — marble floors, clean architectural lines, minimal decor. The camera advances at a measured, intentional pace — not drifting, moving with purpose. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: deep charcoal, cool white, polished steel, muted gold accents. Loop strategy: camera advances through the space to a natural ending point, then cuts to start with a clean dissolve — seamless and intentional. Motion is deliberate. Atmosphere: executive arrival, earned authority, controlled power. Loopable with no jump cuts.
