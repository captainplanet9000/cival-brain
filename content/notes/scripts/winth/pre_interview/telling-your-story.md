=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft piano. Reflective and open.]

Breathe in slowly. Hold for four.
And release. Long and easy.
Once more.

There is a question that appears in every significant interview.
It often comes first.
"Tell me about yourself."
It sounds simple. It is not.
In that question lives an invitation.
Not for a summary of your resume.
For a story.
Your story. The one that explains not just what you did,
but why you did it, what it taught you,
and where it is pointing you now.
Most people answer this question with facts.
The most memorable candidates answer it with a narrative.
Today we build yours.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues, warm and measured.]

Here is the "tell me about yourself" failure pattern.
The candidate recites their resume chronologically.
"I graduated in 2015. I worked at Company A for two years.
Then I moved to Company B where I led a team."
Each fact is accurate. Together they tell nothing.
Facts without meaning are just data.
And data without narrative is forgettable.

What the interviewer actually wants from this question is context.
They want to understand what connects the dots.
Why you made the choices you made.
What you have been building toward.
What working with you would actually be like.
The narrative answers all of that.
The recitation answers none of it.
Here is what makes the narrative different from the recitation.
The narrative has a theme. The recitation does not.
Find the theme. Everything else follows.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters beneath piano. Warm and reflective.]

Here is your three-step personal narrative framework.
Framework: Origin. Development. Now.

Step one is to identify your ORIGIN.
Not your first job. Your first motivation.
What drew you into this field or this type of work?
It might be a person who influenced you.
A problem you encountered early that you could not stop thinking about.
A failure that redirected you.
A strength you discovered before you had a name for it.
Find the moment — or the string of moments — that explains why you do this work.
"From the time I was twenty-two, I was fascinated by how organizations
make decisions under pressure. Every role I've chosen since has put me closer
to the center of that problem."
That origin sentence does something powerful.
It transforms your career from a series of events into a purposeful journey.

Step two is to trace the DEVELOPMENT.
From your origin, briefly trace the path.
Not every job. The three most important stops.
Each stop should contribute one skill, one lesson, or one capability
that you now bring to the current moment.
"At Company A, I learned how to operate with incomplete information.
At Company B, I built my ability to lead cross-functional alignment.
At Company C, I proved that I could deliver transformation, not just improvement."
Three stops. Three contributions. Two minutes maximum.

Step three is to land on the NOW with intention.
"Which brings me here today."
The current moment is not an accident. It is a destination.
"This role is the place where everything I've built gets to be used at its highest level."
That sentence is not arrogance. It is conviction.
And conviction is what separates remembered candidates from forgotten ones.

If your story has a non-linear path, then name the through-line explicitly.
"While the roles look different on paper,
the consistent thread is X. That has been present in everything I've done."
Finding the thread makes the non-linear path coherent.
Coherence is what they are looking for.

If you are early in your career, then your story is about trajectory, not breadth.
"I am building toward X. Every step I have taken has been deliberate.
Here is what I have already learned, and here is what I am ready for next."
Direction is as compelling as experience, when it is genuine.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Piano and cello soften. Warm and still.]

See yourself answering "tell me about yourself" right now.
Your origin is clear. Your path is coherent. Your now is intentional.
The interviewer is listening — not just hearing.
They are making the connection between your story and their opening.
Hear your voice — warm, purposeful, unhurried.
Feel the confidence of someone who knows their story.

I am the professional whose story has a theme and a direction.
I know where I came from and I know where I am going.
My story is coherent, real, and mine.
I tell it with the confidence of someone who has lived it.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano alone. A single warm, clear phrase. Fades.]

Write the origin sentence of your story right now.
One sentence. Why you do this work. Where it began.
That is the beginning of your narrative.

I know my story. I tell it with intention.
The thread runs through everything.
And today I let them see it.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a reflective, narrative instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a thoughtful solo piano melody — the kind that suggests a story beginning. At forty seconds, a cello enters below with warmth and continuity, as if the story is finding its through-line. At one minute forty seconds, both instruments trace a meaningful development — pausing, continuing, building with purpose. At three minutes ten seconds, return to piano alone — resolved and clear, the story landing. At three fifty-five, a warm, complete final phrase. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: narrative arc, found purpose, earned direction. Style: acoustic chamber, storytelling register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow drift forward along a timeline-like surface — a long wooden shelf or wall with objects at intervals, each one different, each one purposeful. The camera moves slowly forward as if following a narrative through space. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: warm wood, muted objects in warm light, gentle progression of objects suggesting a journey. Loop strategy: camera drifts forward along the timeline shelf, reaching the end and easing back in a palindrome — the story told and returned to. Atmosphere: personal narrative, purposeful journey, earned coherence. Loopable with no jump cuts.
