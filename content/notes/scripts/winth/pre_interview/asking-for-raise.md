=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Soft acoustic guitar. Gentle and open.]

Take a slow, full breath in.
Hold it for a moment.
And release. Long and easy.
Once more.

You have been doing work that matters.
Day after day, you show up.
You problem-solve, you adapt, you deliver.
And today, for perhaps the first time in a long time,
you are having the conversation that acknowledges that.
Not because you are demanding something.
Because you are honoring the work you have done
and the value you genuinely bring.
You deserve to have this conversation.
Not maybe. Not if you feel ready enough.
You have earned the right to ask.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Guitar continues, warm and unhurried.]

Here is what makes asking for a raise so difficult emotionally.
We were taught, somewhere along the way,
that asking for more is impolite. Presumptuous. Even greedy.
And so the thought of walking in and naming a number
brings up something that feels like guilt.
But here is what is actually happening.
You are not asking for charity.
You are presenting the case that your compensation
has not kept pace with your contribution.
That is not a demand. That is a professional conversation.
And having that conversation is not just acceptable —
it is expected of professionals who know their worth.
The discomfort you feel is not evidence that you shouldn't ask.
It is evidence that you care. And caring people ask with integrity.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Cello enters gently. Warm and supportive.]

Here is your three-step raise conversation plan.
Plan: Build. Frame. Ask.

Step one is to BUILD your case before the conversation.
Write down your three strongest contributions this year.
Each one must have a real, tangible outcome.
"I took on the project management role for the product launch.
We launched on time with a team that was at sixty percent capacity."
"I built the onboarding framework that reduced training time by three weeks."
"I consistently received the highest client satisfaction scores on the team."
These are not opinions. They are facts. And facts make a foundation.
Also do your market research. Know what the role pays externally.
That number is not a threat. It is context.

Step two is to FRAME the conversation as partnership, not confrontation.
Open with: "I want to talk about my compensation.
I care about this role and this team,
and I want to make sure we're aligned on my value here."
That framing says: I am invested. I am loyal. And I am being direct.
Then present your evidence. Three contributions. One market data point.
Keep the emotional tone warm but grounded.
You are not frustrated. You are professional. You are clear.

Step three is to ASK specifically and then hold the space.
"Based on my contributions and the current market,
I am asking for a salary adjustment to X dollars."
Then be quiet. Breathe. Let them respond.
You do not need to fill the silence with justifications.
The case has been made. The ask has been named.
Now it is their conversation.

If they say they need to check with others, then say:
"I appreciate that. What is the timeline for that conversation?"
Name the next step. Do not leave without it.

If they say the budget is tight, then acknowledge and redirect.
"I understand. I'd like to understand what is possible
and what the path looks like toward the full adjustment."
You are not accepting no as a final answer. You are asking for a plan.

If emotion rises in the conversation, then breathe slowly.
You came with facts and warmth. Return to both.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens. Guitar alone, intimate and warm.]

See yourself in that conversation right now.
You are calm. You are clear. You have your evidence.
You open with warmth and you make the ask with confidence.
They hear you. They see the preparation. They respond with respect.
Hear your voice — kind, grounded, certain.
Feel the peace of someone who advocates for themselves with integrity.

I am the professional who knows my value and asks for it honestly.
I bring evidence. I speak with warmth. I hold my ask.
I deserve to have this conversation. And I am having it.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Guitar fades to a single held note.]

Right now, write three contributions with real outcomes.
Then write the salary number you are asking for.
Say it out loud. Practice until it feels real, not scary.

I have earned this. I ask for it with integrity.
The conversation I deserve is the one I am walking into.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a gently supportive instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with soft acoustic guitar — fingerpicked, warm, like a quiet moment of self-recognition. At forty seconds, a piano joins with a simple melodic line — gentle affirmation. At one minute forty seconds, a cello enters beneath — grounding the piece with emotional warmth and the courage of a difficult but right conversation. At three minutes ten seconds, soften to guitar alone — intimate, honest, close. At three fifty-five, a final warm phrase resolves gently. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: earned self-advocacy, warmth and courage, gentle directness. Style: acoustic folk-chamber, compassionate. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, warm close-up drift across a beautifully lit desk surface — handwritten notes, a small plant, soft morning light creating golden warmth. The camera moves slowly and lovingly, as if recognizing something of worth. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: warm gold, cream, soft amber, gentle green. Loop strategy: camera drifts slowly across the surface from left to right, then eases back in a palindrome — back and forth, warm and unhurried. Atmosphere: self-recognition, earned worth, gentle confidence. Loopable with no jump cuts.
