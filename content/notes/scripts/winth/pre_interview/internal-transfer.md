=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Strong synth. Bright and purposeful.]

One breath. Clean. In and out.
Set the standard.

You are applying for an internal transfer.
And here is the thing most people miss.
An internal transfer is actually harder than an external interview.
Because you carry context. Assumptions. A history.
The interviewers in that room already have an opinion of you.
And your job is not to change that opinion.
Your job is to build on it — and extend it into a new direction.
That requires a specific kind of precision.
Not starting over. Not pretending you're new.
But making a compelling case that you are the right evolution
for the role they need filled. That starts now.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Synth steady. Crisp and forward-moving.]

Here is where internal transfer conversations fail.
The candidate assumes the internal context works in their favor.
"They know my work. They know my character."
True. But they also know your current ceiling.
They know the role you currently occupy.
And the question they are asking — even if they don't say it —
is: "Can this person grow into the new demands? Or are they just escaping their current one?"
You have to answer that unspoken question directly.
Not with defensiveness. With evidence and forward vision.
Show them the growth you've already done in your current role.
Show them the skills you've developed that nobody else saw.
And show them exactly how those skills map to where they need to go.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Synth and percussion build with precision and energy.]

Here is your three-step internal transfer positioning protocol.
Protocol: Differentiate. Map. Commit.

Step one is to DIFFERENTIATE yourself from your current role.
This is the most important step. Do not skip it.
Most internal candidates present their current role and say "I'm ready for more."
That is not differentiation. That is ambition without evidence.
Differentiation sounds like this:
"In my current role, I've operated beyond its scope for the past eighteen months.
Specifically, I have taken on three responsibilities
that belong to the role I am applying for."
Then name those responsibilities. With outcomes. With evidence.
"I led cross-functional alignment for the product launch.
I managed external vendor negotiations that saved sixty thousand dollars.
I built the quarterly reporting framework the team now uses."
You are not just ready. You are already doing it.

Step two is to MAP your skills directly to their new requirements.
Research the new role deeply. Know their pain points.
Then in the interview, connect each skill to a specific need.
"You need someone who can manage stakeholder complexity.
In my current role, I manage relationships across six departments.
Here is specifically how I do that."
The map makes the invisible visible.
It shows that your preparation is the same as your execution.

Step three is to COMMIT to the transition with full ownership.
Acknowledge the timing. Acknowledge the politics.
"I understand this is a significant move. I am prepared to transition smoothly.
I have already spoken with my current manager.
I have a thirty-day transition plan ready to share."
That level of preparation is not common.
It signals that you think like the person who already has the job.

If they ask "why leave your current team," then answer with vision not complaint.
"I have loved this team. The timing is right to grow into a bigger challenge."
Vision forward. Gratitude backward.

If politics around the transfer feel present, then name it openly.
"I understand this may have organizational nuance.
I am committed to handling this transition with care and respect."

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Synth softens to a clear, bright melody.]

See yourself in that internal interview right now.
You are not apologizing for wanting more.
You are presenting the evidence of your readiness.
They are recognizing work they already saw — but now framed precisely.
Hear your voice — direct, clear, deeply prepared.
Feel the confidence of someone who already does the job they're applying for.

I am the professional who has already outgrown where I stand.
I do not wait for permission to grow.
I document the growth and present it with precision.
This transfer is not a wish. It is the next logical step.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Synth resolves to a clean, precise finish.]

Right now, list three responsibilities you currently own
that belong to the role you are applying for.
Write them with outcomes. That is your differentiation.

I perform at the next level before I hold the title.
This transfer is the record catching up to the reality.
Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a precise, forward-moving instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a bright synth lead over a tight percussion grid — purposeful and clean. At forty seconds, a bass synth enters with direction and momentum. At one minute forty seconds, the arrangement is in full precision mode — controlled energy, clear melodic structure, forward-moving. At three minutes, the synth lead plays clean over a stripped rhythm — like the final clarity before a decision. At three fifty-five, a crisp resolution. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: earned progression, forward momentum, precise transition. Style: modern motivational synth, internal advancement register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A smooth upward elevator ride through a glass-walled office building — floors passing outside the glass as the elevator rises, city light visible through the windows. The camera holds steady while the environment moves upward past it. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: cool glass, blue-grey floors passing, warm interior elevator light, steel and glass. Loop strategy: elevator rises through four visible floors, then seamlessly resets to the start — repeating the ascent, continuous upward motion. Atmosphere: internal progression, earned level-up, purposeful advancement. Loopable with no jump cuts.

=== LIBRARY PAIRING OPTIONS ===
Primary Match:
- Visual: Glass Elevator Rise — Office Floors Ascending
  - Why: Upward progression through familiar environment mirrors internal transfer advancement perfectly
  - Alternative: Corporate Stairwell Upward Advance — same internal ascent, different motion type

- Music: Synth Progression — Internal Advancement
  - Why: Bright precise synth at 92 BPM matches high_performance internal transfer energy
  - Alternative: Driving Corporate Rhythm — more grounded, same forward direction

New Custom Prompts:
- Use the Suno and Higgsfield prompts above
- Tailored to internal transfer high_performance positioning protocol
- Both follow all ASMPro format requirements
