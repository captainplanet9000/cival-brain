=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Low piano. Dignified and measured.]

Breathe in for four counts. Hold. Release.
Once more. Clear and deliberate.

You are being interviewed for a management role.
And the most important thing to understand is this.
This interview is not about proving you can do the work.
They already know you can do the work.
This interview is about proving you can create an environment
where others do their best work.
That is a fundamentally different question.
And it requires a different kind of answer.
The shift from individual contributor to manager
is the most significant professional transition most people make.
Show today that you have already made it mentally.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Piano continues, structured and precise.]

Here is the management interview failure pattern.
Candidates describe management as an elevated version of their current role.
"I will do the same things I've been doing, just with more oversight."
That is not management. That is supervision.
Management is about building systems, developing people,
and achieving goals through others — not directly through yourself.

The interviewer is listening for one specific signal.
Has this candidate shifted from "I execute" to "I enable"?
If your answers are all about what you personally did and achieved,
you have not made the shift on camera.
You may have made it in reality.
But on camera is where the decision is made.
We make that shift visible today.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Strings enter under piano. Structured authority.]

Here is your three-step management positioning framework.
Framework: Enable. Develop. Decide.

Step one is to demonstrate that you ENABLE others to succeed.
In every story you tell, include at minimum one team member.
Not "I solved the problem." "My team solved the problem.
Here is the environment I created for them to do it."
"I restructured the workflow so that Maria's strength in analysis
was aligned directly with the highest-impact work.
That shift contributed thirty percent to the final output."
You are not erasing yourself. You are elevating the people around you.
That elevation is the evidence of management capability.

Step two is to show that you actively DEVELOP people.
Management interviewers want to know:
do you make the people who report to you better?
Prepare one specific development story.
"I had a team member who was technically strong but avoiding visibility.
I gave them ownership of the client presentation.
They delivered it well and have since been promoted."
That story shows intentional development.
You saw someone's potential. You created the condition. They grew.
That is management. Name it as such.

Step three is to demonstrate that you DECIDE under uncertainty.
Managers make decisions with incomplete information. Always.
Prepare one decision story where you had to act without full clarity.
"We had competing priorities in Q three.
I made the call to deprioritize feature B
in favor of customer retention work.
It was not universally popular. But the retention metrics justified it."
The ability to decide — own it, explain it, stand by it —
is the core management competency they are testing for.

If they ask about managing someone more senior or experienced, then answer directly.
"I lead through questions and respect, not through hierarchy.
I leverage their expertise and make the final call."

If they ask about underperforming team members, then describe a real process.
"I lead with clarity, direct feedback, and a documented support plan.
If the situation doesn't improve, I manage it fairly and decisively."

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Music softens to a clear piano line.]

See yourself in that management interview right now.
Every answer includes a team member's name.
Every story elevates someone else's performance.
They hear the shift. They feel the management mindset.
Hear your voice — structured, confident, enabling.
Feel the clarity of someone who has already made the transition.

I am the leader who creates conditions for others to excel.
I enable. I develop. I decide.
Management is not a title I am waiting for.
It is a way of operating I already live.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Piano resolves to a single authoritative note.]

Right now, write one enable story, one develop story, one decide story.
One person you lifted. One decision you owned.
That is your management evidence.

I lead before I hold the title.
The title is the confirmation. I am the evidence.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a structured, authoritative instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Begin with a deliberate low piano — measured and grounded, like someone setting expectations. At forty seconds, strings enter with controlled precision — professional, not emotional. At one minute forty seconds, piano and strings build in structured dialogue — like a leader and team working in coordinated purpose. At three minutes ten seconds, reduce to piano alone — clear decisions made, calm certainty remaining. At three fifty-five, a final authoritative chord resolves. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: enabling leadership, structured authority, earned management. Style: modern executive chamber. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A measured forward drift down a clean corporate hallway into an open-plan workspace — desks arranged in organized clusters, morning light through large windows. The camera advances steadily, taking in the ordered space. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no text, no logos. Color palette: clean white, warm wood accents, morning blue through glass, organized grey. Loop strategy: camera advances through the hallway into the workspace, then eases back to the corridor start — palindrome, measured and purposeful. Atmosphere: team environment, enabling culture, organized purpose. Loopable with no jump cuts.

=== LIBRARY PAIRING OPTIONS ===
Primary Match:
- Visual: Corporate Hallway Into Open Workspace — Morning Light
  - Why: Team environment, organized space, enabling culture matches management role framework
  - Alternative: Modern Office Overview Drift — broader team perspective
