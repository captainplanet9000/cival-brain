=== PRODUCTION SCRIPT ===

[0:00-0:50] ATTENTION
[Clean synth. Bright and precise.]

One breath. Clean in. Clean out.
Standard set.

You are about to walk into a case study presentation.
And here is what separates the candidates they remember from the ones they forget.
Not the cleverness of the answer.
Not the depth of the analysis.
The clarity of the structure.
Evaluators are not grading you on being right.
They are grading you on whether they can follow your thinking.
If your thinking is organized, they trust your judgment.
If your thinking is scattered, no amount of analysis saves you.
Structure is the frame. Analysis is the art inside it.
You are bringing both today. Starting with the frame.

[0:50-1:40] NEED
[Synth steady. Crisp and forward.]

Here is the case study presentation failure pattern.
The candidate dives straight into analysis.
They share everything they know, in the order they discovered it.
"So first I looked at the market, and then I noticed the cost structure,
and there was also something interesting about the competitive dynamics..."
The evaluators are tracking three different threads at once.
None of them fully developed.
The candidate finishes, looks up, and the room is nodding — but unclear.
No one has absorbed the analysis because it had no scaffold.
The insight was there. The structure was not.
And the evaluator cannot hire someone whose thinking they cannot follow.
Structure first. Always. Every case.

[1:40-3:10] SATISFACTION
[Synth and percussion build with structural clarity.]

Here is your three-step case presentation framework.
Framework: Frame. Analyze. Recommend.

Step one is to FRAME the case before you analyze it.
Your first sixty seconds should do one thing.
Tell them exactly how you are going to structure your thinking.
"I am going to address this in three parts.
First, I will establish what I believe the core problem is.
Second, I will walk through my analysis of the key variables.
Third, I will give a recommendation with the rationale."
Now they have a map. They know where you are going.
They can follow you with lower cognitive effort.
Lower cognitive effort means higher comprehension.
Higher comprehension means they trust your analysis.
Always start with the map.

Step two is to ANALYZE with explicit logic.
As you walk through each part, name the logic out loud.
"The reason I am prioritizing cost structure over market share here
is that the company is within eighteen months of a liquidity event.
In that context, margin matters more than growth rate."
The explicit logic is more impressive than the conclusion.
Anyone can give a recommendation.
The candidate who names their reasoning builds trust in their judgment.
Name your assumptions. Name your trade-offs.
"If this assumption is wrong, the recommendation changes to X."
That level of transparency under pressure is rare.
And it is exactly what interviewers at the highest levels are looking for.

Step three is to RECOMMEND with conviction and brevity.
When you arrive at the recommendation, give it cleanly.
One sentence for the recommendation.
One sentence for the primary evidence.
One sentence for the most important caveat.
Three sentences. Done.
"My recommendation is to prioritize customer retention over acquisition.
The unit economics favor this by a factor of four to one at current growth rates.
The one assumption I am holding is that churn remains below twelve percent."
Three sentences. Decisive. Clear. Defensible.

If they challenge your recommendation, then welcome it.
"That is a fair challenge. Here is my response to that specific point."
Do not retreat to "it depends." Take a position and defend it.

If you run out of time during analysis, then skip to the recommendation.
"In the interest of time, I want to make sure I give you my conclusion.
I can fill in the middle layer if that is useful."
Never sacrifice the recommendation to save the analysis.
The recommendation is what they remember.

[3:10-3:55] VISUALIZATION
[Synth softens to a bright, precise melody.]

See yourself at the front of that room right now.
You open with the structure. The map is clear.
They settle back slightly. They are ready to follow.
You walk through the analysis with explicit logic.
You close with three sentences of conviction.
Hear your voice — organized, precise, confident.
Feel the clarity of someone who brought a structured mind to a complex problem.

I am the analyst who makes complexity comprehensible.
I frame before I analyze. I analyze with logic. I recommend with conviction.
Structure is my superpower. I bring it every time.

[3:55-4:30] ACTION
[Synth closes clean and precise.]

Right now, write your framework for this presentation.
Frame. Analyze. Recommend. Label each section.
Practice saying the frame sentence out loud.
"I am going to address this in three parts."
That sentence opens everything.

I structure complexity. I make thinking followable.
The room follows me because I lead with clarity.
Let's go.

=== SUNO PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Compose a structured, high-clarity instrumental at ninety-two BPM. Open with a tight synth grid and percussion — each element entering on cue, no waste. At forty seconds, a melodic synth line adds direction and logic, as if a framework is revealing itself. At one minute forty seconds, the full arrangement is executing with crisp precision — structured, clear, purposeful. At three minutes ten seconds, reduce to a single synth lead over minimal percussion — the final structured recommendation. At three fifty-five, a clean, satisfying resolution. Instrumental only, no vocals. Never competing with voiceover. Mood: analytical clarity, structural precision, confident recommendation. Style: modern analytical synth, precision register. Tempo: ninety-two BPM throughout.

=== HIGGSFIELD PROMPT (Natural Language) ===
Vertical nine-to-sixteen format. A slow, organized advance across a clean whiteboard surface — abstract geometric lines and framework structures drawn in clean white, revealing a logical progression from left to right. The camera moves steadily from the framework start to the conclusion area. The center of the frame is clean for captions. No faces, no people, no readable text, no logos. Color palette: clean white surface, bold geometric lines, deep navy, minimal color accent in orange or teal. Loop strategy: camera advances from framework start to conclusion end, then seamlessly cuts back to the beginning — repeating the logical progression. Atmosphere: analytical structure, organized thinking, confident conclusion. Loopable with no jump cuts.

=== LIBRARY PAIRING OPTIONS ===

- Visual: Whiteboard Framework Advance — Clean Geometry
  - Why: Visual framework structure matches case study presentation analytical clarity theme
  - Alternative: Abstract Data Architecture Drift — same structured visual language
